  description: 'Purpose

    This study presents a Deep Learning (DL)-based quality assessment (QA) approach
    for evaluating auto-generated contours (auto-contours) in radiotherapy, with emphasis
    on Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (OART). Leveraging Bayesian Ordinal Classification
    (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds, the method enables confident QA predictions
    without relying on ground truth contours or extensive manual labeling.

    Methods

    We developed a BOC model to classify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction
    uncertainty. A calibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that
    meet clinical accuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios:
    no manual labels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in
    prostate cancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were
    absent, transfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels
    were available.

    Results

    The BOC model delivered robust performance across all scenarios. Fine-tuning with
    just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34 subjects yielded over 90% accuracy
    on test data. Using the calibrated threshold, over 93% of the auto-contours''
    qualities were accurately predicted in over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary
    manual reviews and highlighting cases needing correction.

    Conclusion

    The proposed QA model enhances contouring efficiency in OART by reducing manual
    workload and enabling fast, informed clinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification,
    it ensures safer, more reliable radiotherapy workflows.'

  description: In computational pathology, effectively capturing visual-language embeddings
    from extensive pathology image-text pairs has become increasingly crucial for
    diverse downstream tasks. Although prior studies have fine-tuned models like CLIP
    using large pathology image-text datasets, these models encounter limitations
    due to their separate processing of text and images, restricting their ability
    to capture essential cross-modal relationships critical in pathology. Recent advancements
    in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of vision-language
    models (VLMs) that demonstrate enhanced multimodal capabilities, including stronger
    language comprehension and reasoning skills compared to CLIP. However, while VLMs
    show potential for multimodal embedding, previous efforts have primarily focused
    on text-based tasks, leaving their application to multimodal pathology data largely
    unexplored. In …

  title: 'Leveraging Gait Patterns as Biomarkers: An attention-guided Deep Multiple
    Instance Learning Network for Scoliosis Classification'
  authors:

  venue: arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.03894
  venueType: arxiv
  description: Scoliosis is a spinal curvature disorder that is difficult to detect
    early and can compress the chest cavity, impacting respiratory function and cardiac
    health. Especially for adolescents, delayed detection and treatment result in
    worsening compression. Traditional scoliosis detection methods heavily rely on
    clinical expertise, and X-ray imaging poses radiation risks, limiting large-scale
    early screening. We propose an Attention-Guided Deep Multi-Instance Learning method
    (Gait-MIL) to effectively capture discriminative features from gait patterns,
    which is inspired by ScoNet-MT's pioneering use of gait patterns for scoliosis
    detection. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale dataset based on gait
    patterns for scoliosis classification. The results demonstrate that our study
    improves the performance of using gait as a biomarker for scoliosis detection,
    significantly enhances detection accuracy for the particularly challenging Neutral
    cases, where subtle indicators are often overlooked. Our Gait-MIL also performs
    robustly in imbalanced scenarios, making it a promising tool for large-scale scoliosis
    screening.

  venueType: arxiv
  description: Exploring chemical space to find novel molecules that simultaneously
    satisfy multiple properties is crucial in drug discovery. However, existing methods
    often struggle with trading off multiple properties due to the conflicting or
    correlated nature of chemical properties. To tackle this issue, we introduce InversionGNN
    framework, an effective yet sample-efficient dual-path graph neural network (GNN)
    for multi-objective drug discovery. In the direct prediction path of InversionGNN,
    we train the model for multi-property prediction to acquire knowledge of the optimal
    combination of functional groups. Then the learned chemical knowledge helps the
    inversion generation path to generate molecules with required properties. In order
    to decode the complex knowledge of multiple properties in the inversion path,
    we propose a gradient-based Pareto search method to balance conflicting properties
    and generate Pareto optimal molecules. Additionally, InversionGNN is able to search
    the full Pareto front approximately in discrete chemical space. Comprehensive
    experimental evaluations show that InversionGNN is both effective and sample-efficient
    in various discrete multi-objective settings including drug discovery.

  description: 'Spatial transcriptomics (ST) maps gene expression within tissue at
    individual spots, making it a valuable resource for multimodal representation
    learning. Additionally, ST inherently contains rich hierarchical information both
    across and within modalities. For instance, different spots exhibit varying numbers
    of nonzero gene expressions, corresponding to different levels of cellular activity
    and semantic hierarchies. However, existing methods rely on contrastive alignment
    of image-gene pairs, failing to accurately capture the intricate hierarchical
    relationships in ST data. Here, we propose DELST, the first framework to embed
    hyperbolic representations while modeling hierarchy for image-gene pretraining
    at two levels: (1) Cross-modal entailment learning, which establishes an order
    relationship between genes and images to enhance image representation generalization;
    (2) Intra-modal entailment learning, which encodes gene expression patterns as
    hierarchical relationships, guiding hierarchical learning across different samples
    at a global scale and integrating biological insights into single-modal representations.
    Extensive experiments on ST benchmarks annotated by pathologists demonstrate the
    effectiveness of our framework, achieving improved predictive performance compared
    to existing methods. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/XulinChen/DELST.'

  description: Adapting large-scale pre-trained generative models in a parameter-efficient
    manner is gaining traction. Traditional methods like low rank adaptation achieve
    parameter efficiency by imposing constraints but may not be optimal for tasks

    Stiefel optimizers, we achieve parameter-efficient adaptation of orthogonal matrices.
    Specifically, we introduce Spectral Orthogonal Decomposition Adaptation (SODA),
    which balances computational efficiency and representation capacity. Extensive
    evaluations on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate SODA's effectiveness,
    offering a spectrum-aware alternative to existing fine-tuning methods.

  description: Whole slide images (WSIs) play a vital role in cancer diagnosis and
    prognosis. However, their gigapixel resolution, lack of pixel-level annotations,
    and reliance on unimodal visual data present challenges for accurate and efficient
    computational analysis. Existing methods typically divide WSIs into thousands
    of patches, which increases computational demands and makes it challenging to
    effectively focus on diagnostically relevant regions. Furthermore, these methods
    frequently rely on feature extractors pretrained on natural images, which are
    not optimized for pathology tasks, and overlook multimodal data sources such as
    cellular and textual information that can provide critical insights. To address
    these limitations, we propose the Abnormality-Aware MultiModal (AAMM) learning
    framework, which integrates abnormality detection and multimodal feature learning
    for WSI classification. AAMM incorporates a Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder
    (GMVAE) to identify and select the most informative patches, reducing computational
    complexity while retaining critical diagnostic information. It further integrates
    multimodal features from pathology-specific foundation models, combining patch-level,
    cell-level, and text-level representations through cross-attention mechanisms.
    This approach enhances the ability to comprehensively analyze WSIs for cancer
    diagnosis and subtyping. Extensive experiments on normal-tumor classification
    and cancer subtyping demonstrate that AAMM achieves superior performance compared
    to state-of-the-art methods. By combining abnormal detection with multimodal feature

  description: 'Pathology plays a critical role in diagnosing a wide range of diseases,
    yet existing approaches often rely heavily on task-specific models trained on
    extensive, well-labeled datasets. These methods face sustainability challenges
    due to the diversity of pathologies and the labor-intensive nature of data collection.
    To address these limitations, we highlight the need for universal multimodal embeddings
    that can support multiple downstream tasks. Previous approaches often involve
    fine-tuning CLIP-based models, which handle images and text separately, limiting
    their ability to capture complex multimodal relationships. Additionally, these
    models are evaluated across diverse datasets without a unified benchmark for assessing
    multimodal embeddings in pathology. To address these challenges, we propose MLLM4PUE,
    a novel framework that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate
    Pathology Universal Embeddings. The MLLM4PUE framework not only facilitates robust
    integration of images and text but also enhances understanding and fusion capabilities
    across various tasks. We further introduce the Pathology Multimodal Embedding
    Benchmark (PMEB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the quality of
    pathology multimodal embeddings. PMEB comprises 15 original tasks drawn from 14
    datasets, organized into three meta-tasks: retrieval, classification, and composed

  description: Despite over a half-century of effort by computational chemists, developing
    accurate empirical QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships) models
    for predicting bioactivity directly from chemical structure has remained elusive.
    The difficulties have been especially pronounced for virtual screening, finding
    new active compounds substantially different from the known chemical matter used
    to train the models. Recent breakthroughs have been achieved by employing transfer
    of learning across huge numbers of bioactivity assays, greatly increasing the
    amount and diversity of chemical and biological information that informs each
    model. An early example was Profile-QSAR (pQSAR), a 2-level stacked model, where
    level-2 PLS (Partial Least Squares) models characterize compounds by their profile
    of bioactivity predictions from individual level-1 random forest regression QSAR
    models built on up to 10,000+ other assays. This study introduces metaNN, a meta-learner
    that trains deep neural networks (DNN) for each individual assay initialised from
    a well-generalized consensus DNN optimized across all assays. Comparison of the
    results suggested that while Profile-QSAR and metaNN perform similarly overall,
    metaNN works slightly better for smaller assays which were well-predicted by the
    consensus DNN; whereas pQSAR struggled more with smaller assays, due to the large
    number of level-1 models but was less sensitive to similarity to an overall consensus.
    An ensemble average of both methods combined the strengths of each, working better
    than either alone. The similar performance of the 2 largely orthogonal algorithms

  description: Exploring the functions of genes and gene products is crucial to a
    wide range of fields, including medical research, evolutionary biology, and environmental
    science. However, discovering new functions largely relies on expensive and exhaustive
    wet lab experiments. Existing methods of automatic function annotation or prediction
    mainly focus on protein function prediction with sequence, 3D-structures or protein
    family information. In this study, we propose to tackle the gene function prediction
    problem by exploring Gene Ontology graph and annotation with BERT (GoBERT) to
    decipher the underlying relationships among gene functions. Our proposed novel
    function prediction task utilizes existing functions as inputs and generalizes
    the function prediction to gene and gene products. Specifically, two pre-train
    tasks are designed to jointly train GoBERT to capture both explicit and implicit
    relations of functions. Neighborhood prediction is a self-supervised multi-label
    classification task that captures the explicit function relations. Specified masking
    and recovering task helps GoBERT in finding implicit patterns among functions.
    The pre-trained GoBERT possess the ability to predict novel functions for various
    gene and gene products based on known functional annotations. Extensive experiments,
    biological case studies, and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the
    superiority of our proposed GoBERT.

    the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across five dimensions, including trustfulness,
    fairness, safety, privacy, and robustness. CARES comprises about 41K question-answer
    pairs in both closed and open-ended formats, covering 16 medical image modalities

    promising results, their capability in interpreting and following modification
    instructions remains limited. Some research attempts to address this by incorporating
    Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these approaches still face challenges

  authors:

  date: 2024/9/29
  description: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly popular in processing
    graph-structured data, yet they face significant challenges when training and
    testing distributions diverge, common in real-world scenarios. This divergence
    often leads to substantial performance drops in GNN models. To address this, we
    introduce a novel approach that effectively enhances GNN performance in Out-of-Distribution
    (OOD) scenarios, called Causal Subgraphs and Information Bottlenecks (CSIB). CSIB
    is guided by causal modeling principles to generate causal subgraphs while concurrently
    considering both Fully Informative Invariant Features (FIIF) and Partially Informative
    Invariant Features (PIIF) situations. Our approach uniquely combines the principles
    of invariant risk minimization and graph information bottleneck. This integration
    not only guides the generation of causal subgraphs but also underscores the necessity
    of …

  description: 'Large-scale scientific simulations generate massive datasets that
    pose significant challenges for storage and I/O. While traditional lossy compression
    techniques can improve performance, balancing compression ratio, data quality,
    and throughput remains difficult. To address this, we propose NeurLZ, a novel
    cross-field learning-based and error-controlled compression framework for scientific
    data. By integrating skipping DNN models, cross-field learning, and error control,
    our framework aims to substantially enhance lossy compression performance. Our
    contributions are three-fold: (1) We design a lightweight skipping model to provide
    high-fidelity detail retention, further improving prediction accuracy. (2) We
    adopt a cross-field learning approach to significantly improve data prediction
    accuracy, resulting in a substantially improved compression ratio. (3) We develop
    an error control approach to provide strict error bounds according to user requirements.
    We evaluated NeurLZ on several real-world HPC application datasets, including
    Nyx (cosmological simulation), Miranda (large turbulence simulation), and Hurricane
    (weather simulation). Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves up to
    a 90% relative reduction in bit rate under the same data distortion, compared

  description: Given a graph G, the network collapse problem (NCP) selects a vertex
    subset S of minimum cardinality from G such that the difference in the values
    of a given measure function f (G)− f (G∖ S) is greater than a predefined collapse
    threshold. Many graph analytic applications can be formulated as NCPs with different
    measure functions, which often pose a significant challenge due to their NP-hard
    nature. As a result, traditional greedy algorithms, which select the vertex with
    the highest reward at each step, may not effectively find the optimal solution.
    In addition, existing learning-based algorithms do not have the ability to model
    the sequence of actions taken during the decision-making process, making it difficult
    to capture the combinatorial effect of selected vertices on the final solution.
    This limits the performance of learning-based approaches in non-submodular NCPs.

  description: Acquiring meaningful representations of gene expression is essential
    for the accurate prediction of downstream regulatory tasks, such as identifying
    promoters and transcription factor binding sites. However, the current dependency
    on supervised learning, constrained by the limited availability of labeled genomic
    data, impedes the ability to develop robust predictive models with broad generalization
    capabilities. In response, recent advancements have pivoted towards the application
    of self-supervised training for DNA sequence modeling, enabling the adaptation
    of pre-trained genomic representations to a variety of downstream tasks. Departing
    from the straightforward application of masked language learning techniques to
    DNA sequences, approaches such as MoDNA enrich genome language modeling with prior
    biological knowledge. In this study, we advance DNA language models by utilizing
    the Motif-oriented DNA (MoDNA) pre-training framework, which is established for

  description: Learning with noisy labels (LNL) has attracted significant attention
    from the research community. Many recent LNL methods rely on the assumption that
    clean samples tend to have a “small loss.” However, this assumption often fails
    to generalize to some real-world cases with imbalanced subpopulations, that is,
    training subpopulations that vary in sample size or recognition difficulty. Therefore,

    leading to poor generalization performance. To address this issue, we propose

  description: As federated learning gains increasing importance in real-world applications
    due to its capacity for decentralized data training, addressing fairness concerns

  description: The performance of deep learning models heavily relies on the quality
    of the training data. Inadequacies in the training data, such as corrupt input
    or noisy labels, can lead to the failure of model generalization. Recent studies
    propose repairing the model by identifying the training samples that contribute
    to the failure and removing their influence from the model. However, it is important
    to note that the identified data may contain both beneficial and detrimental information.
    Simply erasing the information of the identified data from the model can have
    a negative impact on its performance, especially when accurate data is mistakenly
    identified as detrimental and removed. To overcome this challenge, we propose
    a novel approach that leverages the knowledge obtained from a retained clean set.
    Our method first identifies harmful data by utilizing the clean set, then separates
    the beneficial and detrimental information within the identified data. Finally,
    we utilize the extracted beneficial information to enhance the model's performance.
    Through empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline
    approaches in both identifying harmful data and rectifying model failures. Particularly
    in scenarios where identification is challenging and a significant amount of benign
    data is involved, our method improves performance while the baselines deteriorate
    due to the erroneous removal of beneficial information.

  title: pan-MHC and cross-species prediction of T cell receptor-antigen binding
  authors:

  date: 2023/12/4
  venue: bioRxiv
  venueType: other
  description: Profiling the binding of T cell receptors (TCRs) of T cells to antigenic
    peptides presented by MHC proteins is one of the most important unsolved problems
    in modern immunology. Traditional experimental methods to probe TCR-antigen interactions
    are slow, labor-intensive, costly, and yield moderate throughput. To address this
    problem, we developed pMTnet-omni, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system based
    on hybrid protein sequence and structure information, to predict the pairing of
    TCRs of αβ T cells with peptide-MHC complexes (pMHCs). pMTnet-omni is capable
    of handling peptides presented by both class I and II pMHCs, and capable of handling
    both human and mouse TCR-pMHC pairs, through large-scale information sharing and
    this hybrid design. pMTnet-omni achieves a high overall Area Under the Curve of
    Receiver Operator Characteristics (AUROC) of 0.89, which surpasses competing tools
    by a large margin. We showed that pMTnet-omni can distinguish binding affinity
    of TCRs with similar sequences. Across a range of datasets from various biological
    contexts, pMTnet-omni characterized the longitudinal evolution and spatial heterogeneity
    of TCR-pMHC interactions and their functional impact. We successfully developed
    a biomarker based on pMTnet-omni for predicting immune-related adverse events
    of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment in a cohort of 57 ICI-treated patients.
    pMTnet-omni represents a major advance towards developing a clinically usable
    AI system for TCR-pMHC pairing prediction that can aid the design and implementation
    of TCR-based immunotherapeutics.

  description: 'ChatGPT, as a recently launched large language model (LLM), has shown
    superior performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
    two major limitations hinder its potential applications: 1) the inflexibility

  description: Traditionally, catalog relationship problems in e-commerce stores have
    been handled as pairwise classification tasks, which limit the ability of machine
    learning models to learn from the diverse relationships among different entities
    in the catalog. In this paper, we leverage heterogeneous graphs and Graph Neural

    data sources, and then explore how to utilizing GNNs to leverage the knowledge
    of the constructed graph in a self-supervised fashion. We finally propose a distillation
    approach to transfer the knowledge learned by GNNs into a pairwise neural network
    for seamless deployment in the catalog pipeline that relies on pairwise input
    for inductive relationship inference. Our experiments exhibit that in two of the

  description: Multispectral imaging has a broad, promising and advantageous application
    prospect in the diagnosis of skin diseases. However, there are inherent deviations
    such as rigid or non-rigid deformation among multispectral images (MSI), which
    makes accurate and robust registration algorithms desirable to extract reliable
    multispectral features. Existing registration algorithms are susceptible to significant
    and nonlinear amplitude differences and geometric distortions among MSI, resulting
    in an unsatisfactory estimation of the registration field (RF). In this study,
    we propose an end-to-end multispectral image registration (MSIR) network with
    unsupervised learning for human skin disease diagnosis. First, we propose a basic
    adjacent-band pair registration (ABPR) model to obtain the corresponding RFs through
    simultaneously modeling a series of image pairs from adjacent bands. Second, we

  description: Digital pathology plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and interpretation
    of diseases and has drawn increasing attention in modern healthcare. Due to the
    huge gigapixel-level size and diverse nature of whole-slide images (WSIs), analyzing
    them through multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a widely-used scheme,
    which, however, faces the challenges that come with the weakly supervised nature
    of MIL. Conventional MIL methods mostly either utilized instance-level or bag-level
    supervision to learn informative representations from WSIs for downstream tasks.
    In this work, we propose a novel MIL method for pathological image analysis with
    integrated instance-level and bag-level supervision (termed IIB-MIL). More importantly,

  date: 2023/10/1
  description: Multimodal fusion of different types of neural image data offers an
    invaluable opportunity to leverage complementary cross-modal information and has
    greatly advanced our understanding of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor
    to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Current multi-modal fusion methods assume that both
    brain’s natural geometry and the related feature embeddings are in Euclidean space.
    However, recent studies have suggested that non-Euclidean hyperbolic space may
    provide a more accurate interpretation of brain connectomes than Euclidean space.
    In light of these findings, we propose a novel graph-based hyperbolic deep model
    with a learnable topology to integrate the individual structural network with
    functional information in hyperbolic space for the MCI/NC (normal control) classification
    task. We comprehensively compared the classification performance of the proposed

  description: Electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated multi-phase computed tomography angiography

  description: AI-aided drug discovery (AIDD) is gaining popularity due to its potential
    to make the search for new pharmaceuticals faster, less expensive, and more effective.
    Despite its extensive use in numerous fields (eg, ADMET prediction, virtual screening),
    little research has been conducted on the out-of-distribution (OOD) learning problem
    with noise. We present DrugOOD, a systematic OOD dataset curator and benchmark
    for AIDD. Particularly, we focus on the drug-target binding affinity prediction
    problem, which involves both macromolecule (protein target) and small-molecule
    (drug compound). DrugOOD offers an automated dataset curator with user-friendly
    customization scripts, rich domain annotations aligned with biochemistry knowledge,
    realistic noise level annotations, and rigorous benchmarking of SOTA OOD algorithms,
    as opposed to only providing fixed datasets. Since the molecular data is often
    modeled as irregular graphs using graph neural network (GNN) backbones, DrugOOD
    also serves as a valuable testbed for graph OOD learning problems. Extensive empirical
    studies have revealed a significant performance gap between in-distribution and
    out-of-distribution experiments, emphasizing the need for the development of more
    effective schemes that permit OOD generalization under noise for AIDD.

  date: 2023/4/30
  description: Despite the success of graph neural networks (GNNs) over the Web in
    recent years, the typical transductive learning setting for node classification
    requires GNNs to be retrained frequently, making them vulnerable to poisoning
    attacks by corrupting the training graph. Poisoning attacks on graphs are, however,
    non-trivial as the attack space is potentially large, and the discrete graph structure
    makes the poisoning function non-differentiable. In this paper, we revisit the
    bi-level optimization problem in graph poisoning and propose a novel graph poisoning
    method, termed Curriculum Graph Poisoning (CuGPo), inspired by curriculum learning.
    In contrast to other poisoning attacks that use heuristics or directly optimize
    the graph, our method learns to generate poisoned graphs from basic adversarial
    knowledge first and advanced knowledge later. Specifically, for the outer optimization,

  description: The accurate segmentation of nuclei is crucial for cancer diagnosis
    and further clinical treatments. To successfully train a nuclei segmentation network
    in a fully-supervised manner for a particular type of organ or cancer, we need
    the dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, such well-annotated nuclei
    segmentation datasets are highly rare, and manually labeling an unannotated dataset
    is an expensive, time-consuming, and tedious process. Consequently, we require
    to discover a way for training the nuclei segmentation network with unlabeled
    dataset. In this paper, we propose a model named NuSegUDA for nuclei segmentation
    on the unlabeled dataset (target domain). It is achieved by applying Unsupervised
    Domain Adaptation (UDA) technique with the help of another labeled dataset (source
    domain) that may come from different type of organ, cancer, or source. We apply
    UDA technique at both of feature space and output space. We additionally utilize
    a reconstruction network and incorporate adversarial learning into it so that
    the source-domain images can be accurately translated to the target-domain for
    further training of the segmentation network. We validate our proposed NuSegUDA
    on two public nuclei segmentation datasets, and obtain significant improvement
    as compared with the baseline methods. Extensive experiments also verify the contribution
    of newly proposed image reconstruction adversarial loss, and target-translated
    source supervised loss to the performance boost of NuSegUDA. Finally, considering
    the scenario when we have a small number of annotations available from the target

  description: Fine-grained nucleus classification is challenging because of the high
    inter-class similarity and intra-class variability. Therefore, a large number
    of labeled data is required for training effective nucleus classification models.
    However, it is challenging to label a large-scale nucleus classification dataset
    comparable to ImageNet in natural images, considering that high-quality nucleus
    labeling requires specific domain knowledge. In addition, the existing publicly
    available datasets are often inconsistently labeled with divergent labeling criteria.
    Due to this inconsistency, conventional models have to be trained on each dataset
    separately and work independently to infer their own classification results, limiting
    their classification performance. To fully utilize all annotated datasets, we

  description: Mitosis counting of biopsies is an important biomarker for breast cancer

    independently tested on multicenter breast histopathological images. To capture
    more refined morphological features of cells, we convert the object detection

  venueType: conference
  description: Designing feasible and effective architectures under diverse computational
    budgets, incurred by different applications/devices, is essential for deploying
    deep models in real-world applications. To achieve this goal, existing methods
    often perform an independent architecture search process for each target budget,
    which is very inefficient yet unnecessary. More critically, these independent
    search processes cannot share their learned knowledge (ie, the distribution of
    good architectures) with each other and thus often result in limited search results.
    To address these issues, we propose a Pareto-aware Neural Architecture Generator
    (PNAG) which only needs to be trained once and dynamically produces the Pareto
    optimal architecture for any given budget via inference. To train our PNAG, we
    learn the whole Pareto frontier by jointly finding multiple Pareto optimal architectures
    under diverse budgets. Such a joint search algorithm not only greatly reduces
    the overall search cost but also improves the search results. Extensive experiments
    on three hardware platforms (ie, mobile device, CPU, and GPU) show the superiority
    of our method over existing methods.

  description: Benefiting from the large-scale archiving of digitized whole-slide
    images (WSIs), computer-aided diagnosis has been well developed to assist pathologists
    in decision-making. Content-based WSI retrieval can be a new approach to find
    highly correlated WSIs in a historically diagnosed WSI archive, which has the
    potential usages for assisted clinical diagnosis, medical research, and trainee
    education. During WSI retrieval, it is particularly challenging to encode the
    semantic content of histopathological images and to measure the similarity between
    images for interpretable results due to the gigapixel size of WSIs. In this work,
    we propose a Retrieval with Clustering-guided Contrastive Learning (RetCCL) framework
    for robust and accurate WSI-level image retrieval, which integrates a novel self-supervised
    feature learning method and a global ranking and aggregation algorithm for much

  description: Molecule generation is the procedure to generate initial novel molecule
    proposals for molecule design. Molecules are first projected into continuous vectors
    in chemical latent space, and then, these embedding vectors are decoded into molecules
    under the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. The continuous latent space
    of VAE can be utilized to generate novel molecules with desired chemical properties
    and further optimize the desired chemical properties of molecules. However, there
    is a posterior collapse problem with the conventional recurrent neural network-based
    VAEs for the molecule sequence generation, which deteriorates the generation performance.
    We investigate the posterior collapse problem and find that the underestimated
    reconstruction loss is the main factor in the posterior collapse problem in molecule
    sequence generation. To support our conclusion, we present both analytical and

  description: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the knowledge
    learnt from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous work
    is mainly built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn domain-invariant
    representations. With the recent exponential increase in applying Vision Transformer
    (ViT) to vision tasks, the capability of ViT in adapting cross-domain knowledge,
    however, remains unexplored in the literature. To fill this gap, this paper first
    comprehensively investigates the performance of ViT on a variety of domain adaptation
    tasks. Surprisingly, ViT demonstrates superior generalization ability, while the
    performance can be further improved by incorporating adversarial adaptation. Notwithstanding,
    directly using CNNs-based adaptation strategies fails to take the advantage of
    ViT's intrinsic merits (eg, attention mechanism and sequential image representation)
    which play an important role in knowledge transfer. To remedy this, we propose
    an unified framework, namely Transferable Vision Transformer (TVT), to fully exploit
    the transferability of ViT for domain adaptation. Specifically, we delicately
    devise a novel and effective unit, which we term Transferability Adaption Module
    (TAM). By injecting learned transferabilities into attention blocks, TAM compels
    ViT focus on both transferable and discriminative features. Besides, we leverage
    discriminative clustering to enhance feature diversity and separation which are
    undermined during adversarial domain alignment. To verify its versatility, we
    perform extensive studies of TVT on four benchmarks and the experimental results
    demonstrate that TVT attains significant …

  description: Weakly-supervised whole-slide image (WSI) classification (WSWC) is
    a challenging task where a large number of unlabeled patches (instances) exist
    within each WSI (bag) while only a slide label is given. Despite recent progress
    for the multiple instance learning (MIL)-based WSI analysis, the major limitation
    is that it usually focuses on the easy-to-distinguish diagnosis-positive regions
    while ignoring positives that occupy a small ratio in the entire WSI. To obtain
    more discriminative features, we propose a novel weakly-supervised classification
    method based on cross-slide contrastive learning (called SCL-WC), which depends
    on task-agnostic self-supervised feature pre-extraction and task-specific weakly-supervised
    feature refinement and aggregation for WSI-level prediction. To enable both intra-WSI
    and inter-WSI information interaction, we propose a positive-negative-aware module
    (PNM) and a weakly-supervised cross-slide contrastive learning (WSCL) module,
    respectively. The WSCL aims to pull WSIs with the same disease types closer and
    push different WSIs away. The PNM aims to facilitate the separation of tumor-like
    patches and normal ones within each WSI. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
    performance of our method in three different classification tasks (eg, over 2%
    of AUC in Camelyon16, 5% of F1 score in BRACS, and 3% of AUC in DiagSet). Our
    method also shows superior flexibility and scalability in weakly-supervised localization
    and semi-supervised classification experiments (eg, first place in the BRIGHT
    challenge). Our code will be available at https://github. com/Xiyue-Wang/SCL-WC.

  venueType: conference
  description: 'Though the multiscale graph learning techniques have enabled advanced
    feature extraction frameworks, we find that the classic ensemble strategy shows
    inferior performance while encountering the high homogeneity of the learnt representation,
    which is caused by the nature of existing graph pooling methods. To cope with
    this issue, we propose a diversified multiscale graph learning model equipped
    with two core ingredients: a graph self-correction mechanism to generate informative
    embedded graphs, and a diversity boosting regularizer to achieve a comprehensive
    characterization of the input graph. The proposed mechanism compensates the pooled
    graph with the lost information during the graph pooling process by feeding back
    the estimated residual graph, which serves as a plug-in component for popular
    graph pooling methods. Meanwhile, pooling methods enhanced with the self-correcting
    procedure encourage the discrepancy of node embeddings, and thus it contributes
    to the success of ensemble learning strategy. The proposed regularizer instead
    enhances the ensemble diversity at the graph-level embeddings by leveraging the
    interaction among individual classifiers. Extensive experiments on popular graph
    classification benchmarks show that the approaches lead to significant improvements
    over state-of-the-art graph pooling methods, and the ensemble multiscale graph

    limitation, we propose an innovative retrosynthesis prediction framework that
    can compose novel templates beyond training templates. As far as we know, this
    is the first method that uses machine learning to compose reaction templates for
    retrosynthesis prediction. Besides, we propose an effective reactant candidate
    scoring model that can capture atom-level transformations, which helps our method
    outperform previous methods on the USPTO-50K dataset. Experimental results show
    that our method can produce novel templates for 15 USPTO-50K test reactions that

  description: Human and non-human primates produce rhythmical sounds as soon as they

    of caregivers. How they develop remains a mystery. The orofacial movements necessary
    for producing these vocalizations have distinct spatiotemporal signatures. Therefore,
    their development could potentially be tracked over the course of prenatal life.
    We densely and longitudinally sampled fetal head and orofacial movements in marmoset
    monkeys using ultrasound imaging. We show that orofacial movements necessary for
    producing rhythmical vocalizations differentiate from a larger movement pattern
    that includes the entire head. We also show that signature features of marmoset

    Our results establish that aspects of the sensorimotor development necessary for
    vocalizing occur prenatally, even before the production of sound.

  description: The protein tertiary structure largely determines its interaction with
    other molecules. Despite its importance in various structure-related tasks, fully-supervised
    data are often time-consuming and costly to obtain. Existing pre-training models
    mostly focus on amino-acid sequences or multiple sequence alignments, while the
    structural information is not yet exploited. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised
    pre-training model for learning structure embeddings from protein tertiary structures.
    Native protein structures are perturbed with random noise, and the pre-training
    model aims at estimating gradients over perturbed 3D structures. Specifically,
    we adopt SE (3)-invariant features as model inputs and reconstruct gradients over
    3D coordinates with SE (3)-equivariance preserved. Such paradigm avoids the usage
    of sophisticated SE (3)-equivariant models, and dramatically improves the computational
    efficiency of pre-training models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-training
    model on two downstream tasks, protein structure quality assessment (QA) and protein-protein
    interaction (PPI) site prediction. Hierarchical structure embeddings are extracted
    to enhance corresponding prediction models. Extensive experiments indicate that
    such structure embeddings consistently improve the prediction accuracy for both
    downstream tasks.

  venueType: conference
  description: Retrosynthetic planning plays an important role in the field of organic
    chemistry, which could generate a synthetic route for the target product. The
    synthetic route is a series of reactions which are started from the available
    molecules. The most challenging problem in the generation of the synthetic route
    is the large search space of the candidate reactions. Estimating the cost of candidate
    reactions has been proved effectively to prune the search space, which could achieve
    a higher accuracy with the same search iteration. And the estimation of one reaction
    is comprised of the estimations of all its reactants. So, how to estimate the
    cost of these reactants will directly influence the quality of results. To get
    a better performance, we propose a new framework, named GNN-Retro, for retrosynthetic
    planning problem by combining graph neural networks (GNN) and the latest search
    algorithm. The structure of GNN in our framework could incorporate the information
    of neighboring molecules, which will improve the estimation accuracy of our framework.
    The experiments on the USPTO dataset show that our framework could outperform
    the state-of-the-art methods with a large margin under the same settings.

  venue: International conference on machine learning
  venueType: conference
  description: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance on
    graph-based tasks. The key idea for GNNs is to obtain informative representation
    through aggregating information from local neighborhoods. However, it remains
    an open question whether the neighborhood information is adequately aggregated
    for learning representations of nodes with few neighbors. To address this, we
    propose a simple and efficient data augmentation strategy, local augmentation,
    to learn the distribution of the node representations of the neighbors conditioned
    on the central node’s representation and enhance GNN’s expressive power with generated
    features. Local augmentation is a general framework that can be applied to any
    GNN model in a plug-and-play manner. It samples feature vectors associated with
    each node from the learned conditional distribution as additional input for the
    backbone model at each training iteration. Extensive experiments and analyses
    show that local augmentation consistently yields performance improvement when
    applied to various GNN architectures across a diverse set of benchmarks. For example,
    experiments show that plugging in local augmentation to GCN and GAT improves by
    an average of 3.4% and 1.6% in terms of test accuracy on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed.
    Besides, our experimental results on large graphs (OGB) show that our model consistently
    improves performance over backbones. Code is available at https://github. com/SongtaoLiu0823/LAGNN.

  venue: International conference on machine learning
  venueType: conference
  description: Transferability estimation has been an essential tool in selecting
    a pre-trained model and the layers in it for transfer learning, to transfer, so
    as to maximize the performance on a target task and prevent negative transfer.
    Existing estimation algorithms either require intensive training on target tasks
    or have difficulties in evaluating the transferability between layers. To this
    end, we propose a simple, efficient, and effective transferability measure named
    TransRate. Through a single pass over examples of a target task, TransRate measures
    the transferability as the mutual information between features of target examples
    extracted by a pre-trained model and their labels. We overcome the challenge of
    efficient mutual information estimation by resorting to coding rate that serves
    as an effective alternative to entropy. From the perspective of feature representation,
    the resulting TransRate evaluates both completeness (whether features contain
    sufficient information of a target task) and compactness (whether features of
    each class are compact enough for good generalization) of pre-trained features.
    Theoretically, we have analyzed the close connection of TransRate to the performance
    after transfer learning. Despite its extraordinary simplicity in 10 lines of codes,
    TransRate performs remarkably well in extensive evaluations on 35 pre-trained
    models and 16 downstream tasks.

  description: '3D delineation of anatomical structures is a cardinal goal in medical
    imaging analysis. Prior to deep learning, statistical shape models (SSMs) that
    imposed anatomical constraints and produced high quality surfaces were a core
    technology. Today’s fully-convolutional networks (FCNs), while dominant, do not
    offer these capabilities. We present deep implicit statistical shape models (DISSMs),
    a new approach that marries the representation power of deep networks with the
    benefits of SSMs. DISSMs use an implicit representation to produce compact and
    descriptive deep surface embeddings that permit statistical models of anatomical
    variance. To reliably fit anatomically plausible shapes to an image, we introduce
    a novel rigid and non-rigid pose estimation pipeline that is modelled as a Markov
    decision process (MDP). Intra-dataset experiments on the task of pathological
    liver segmentation demonstrate that DISSMs can perform more robustly than four
    leading FCN models, including nnU-Net+ an adversarial prior: reducing the mean
    Hausdorff distance (HD) by 7.5-14.3 mm and improving the worst case Dice-Sørensen
    coefficient (DSC) by 1.2-2.3%. More critically, cross-dataset experiments on an
    external and highly challenging clinical dataset demonstrate that DISSMs improve
    the mean DSC and HD by 2.1-5.9% and 9.9-24.5 mm, respectively, and the worst-case
    DSC by 5.4-7.3%. Supplemental validation on a highly challenging and low-contrast
    larynx dataset further demonstrate DISSM’s improvements. These improvements are
    over and above any benefits from representing delineations with high-quality surfaces.'

  description: Recently, deep neural networks have greatly advanced undersampled Magnetic
    Resonance Image (MRI) reconstruction, wherein most studies follow the one-anatomy-one-network
    fashion, i.e., each expert network is trained and evaluated for a specific anatomy.
    Apart from inefficiency in training multiple independent models, such convention
    ignores the shared de-aliasing knowledge across various anatomies which can benefit
    each other. To explore the shared knowledge, one naive way is to combine all the
    data from various anatomies to train an all-round network. Unfortunately, despite
    the existence of the shared de-aliasing knowledge, we reveal that the exclusive
    knowledge across different anatomies can deteriorate specific reconstruction targets,
    yielding overall performance degradation. Observing this, in this study, we present
    a novel deep MRI reconstruction framework with both anatomy-shared and anatomy-specific
    parameterized learners, aiming to "seek common ground while reserving differences"
    across different anatomies.Particularly, the primary anatomy-shared learners are
    exposed to different anatomies to model flourishing shared knowledge, while the
    efficient anatomy-specific learners are trained with their target anatomy for
    exclusive knowledge. Four different implementations of anatomy-specific learners
    are presented and explored on the top of our framework in two MRI reconstruction

    that three of these learners are able to enhance reconstruction performance via

    This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence model for predicting the
    pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) of
    locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) using digital pathological images.

    Background

    nCRT followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) is a standard treatment strategy
    for patients with LARC. Predicting the PCR to nCRT of LARC remine difficulty.

    Methods

    842 LARC patients treated with standard nCRT from three medical centers were retrospectively
    recruited and subgrouped into the training, testing and external validation sets.
    Treatment response was classified as pCR and non-pCR based on the pathological
    diagnosis after surgery as the ground truth. The hematoxylin & eosin (H&E)-stained
    biopsy slides were manually annotated and used to develop a deep pathological
    complete response (DeepPCR) prediction model by deep learning.

    Results

    The proposed DeepPCR model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.710 (95% CI: 0.595, 0.808)
    in the testing cohort. Similarly, in the external validation cohort, the DeepPCR
    model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.723 (95% CI: 0.591, 0.844). The sensitivity and
    specificity of the DeepPCR model were 72.6% and 46.9% in the testing set and 72.5%
    and 62.7% in the external validation cohort, respectively. Multivariate logistic
    regression analysis showed that the DeepPCR model was an independent predictive
    factor of nCRT (P=0.008 and P=0.004 for the testing set and external validation
    set, respectively).

    The DeepPCR model showed high accuracy in predicting pCR and served as an independent

  description: The secondary structure of proteins is significant for studying the
    three-dimensional structure and functions of proteins. Several models from image
    understanding and natural language modeling have been successfully adapted in
    the protein sequence study area, such as Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network
    and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Recently, Gated Convolutional Neural Network
    (GCNN) has been proposed for natural language processing. It has achieved high
    levels of sentence scoring, as well as reduced the latency. Conditionally Parameterized
    Convolution (CondConv) is another novel study which has gained great success in
    the image processing area. Compared with vanilla CNN, CondConv uses extra sample-dependant
    modules to conditionally adjust the convolutional network. In this paper, we propose
    a novel Conditionally Parameterized Convolutional network (CondGCNN) which utilizes
    the power of both CondConv and GCNN. CondGCNN leverages an ensemble encoder to
    combine the capabilities of both LSTM and CondGCNN to encode protein sequences
    by better capturing protein sequential features. In addition, we explore the similarity
    between the secondary structure prediction problem and the image segmentation
    problem, and propose an ASP network (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) based
    network) to capture fine boundary details in secondary structure. Extensive experiments
    show that the proposed method can achieve higher performance on protein secondary

  description: Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is a potential genomic biomarker of immunotherapy.
    However, TMB detected through whole exome sequencing lacks clinical penetration
    in low-resource settings. In this study, we proposed a multi-scale deep learning
    framework to address the detection of TMB status from routinely used whole slide
    images for a multiple cancer TMB prediction model (MC- TMB). The MC-TMB achieved
    a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.818 (0.804-0.831) in the cross-validation
    cohort, which showed superior performance to each single-scale model. The improvements
    of MC-TMB over the single-tumor models were also confirmed by the ablation tests
    on x10 magnification, and the highly concerned regions typically correspond to
    dense lymphocytic infiltration and heteromorphic tumor cells. MC-TMB algorithm
    also exhibited good generalization on the external validation cohort with an AUC
    of 0.732 (0.683-0.761), and better performance when compared to other methods.

  description: As a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships, hypergraphs

    weights (EDVWs) that have more modeling power. To compensate for this, we present
    General Hypergraph Spectral Convolution (GHSC), a general learning framework that
    not only handles EDVW and EIVW hypergraphs, but more importantly, enables theoretically
    explicitly utilizing the existing powerful Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

  description: 'Conventional deep models predict a test sample with a single forward

    how to construct looped inference, so that the original erroneous predictions

    auxiliary learning task based on its original top- predictions to calibrate the

    objects is a challenging topic in machine learning. The challenges mainly stem
    from that the interacting systems are exponentially-compositional, symmetrical,
    and commonly geometrically-constrained. Current methods, particularly the ones
    based on equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have targeted on the first
    two challenges but remain immature for constrained systems. In this paper, we
    propose Graph Mechanics Network (GMN) which is combinatorially efficient, equivariant
    and constraint-aware. The core of GMN is that it represents, by generalized coordinates,
    the forward kinematics information (positions and velocities) of a structural
    object. In this manner, the geometrical constraints are implicitly and naturally
    encoded in the forward kinematics. Moreover, to allow equivariant message passing
    in GMN, we have developed a general form of orthogonality-equivariant functions,
    given that the dynamics of constrained systems are more complicated than the unconstrained
    counterparts. Theoretically, the proposed equivariant formulation is proved to
    be universally expressive under certain conditions. Extensive experiments support
    the advantages of GMN compared to the state-of-the-art GNNs in terms of prediction
    accuracy, constraint satisfaction and data efficiency on the simulated systems
    consisting of particles, sticks and hinges, as well as two real-world datasets
    for molecular dynamics prediction and human motion capture.

  description: 'With the success of the graph embedding model in both academic and
    industrial areas, the robustness of graph embeddings against adversarial attacks
    inevitably becomes a crucial problem in graph learning. Existing works usually
    perform the attack in a white-box fashion: they need to access the predictions/labels
    to construct their adversarial losses. However, the inaccessibility of predictions/labels
    makes the white-box attack impractical for a real graph learning system. This
    paper promotes current frameworks in a more general and flexible sense – we consider
    the ability of various types of graph embedding models to remain resilient against
    black-box driven attacks. We investigate the theoretical connection between graph
    signal processing and graph embedding models, and formulate the graph embedding
    model as a general graph signal process with a corresponding graph filter. Therefore,

  description: 'Recently, Transformer model, which has achieved great success in many
    artificial intelligence fields, has demonstrated its great potential in modeling
    graph-structured data. Till now, a great variety of Transformers has been proposed
    to adapt to the graph-structured data. However, a comprehensive literature review
    and systematical evaluation of these Transformer variants for graphs are still
    unavailable. It''s imperative to sort out the existing Transformer models for
    graphs and systematically investigate their effectiveness on various graph tasks.
    In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of various Graph Transformer
    models from the architectural design perspective. We first disassemble the existing
    models and conclude three typical ways to incorporate the graph information into
    the vanilla Transformer: 1) GNNs as Auxiliary Modules, 2) Improved Positional
    Embedding from Graphs, and 3) Improved Attention Matrix from Graphs. Furthermore,
    we implement the representative components in three groups and conduct a comprehensive
    comparison on various kinds of famous graph data benchmarks to investigate the
    real performance gain of each component. Our experiments confirm the benefits
    of current graph-specific modules on Transformer and reveal their advantages on
    different kinds of graph tasks.'

  description: 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate unprecedented achievements
    on various machine learning problems and applications. However, such impressive
    performance heavily relies on massive amounts of labeled data which requires considerable
    time and labor efforts to collect and annotate. To remedy this limitation, unsupervised
    domain adaptation (UDA) has attracted more and more attention in the past decade,
    owing to its capability in transferring the knowledge learned from a labeled source
    domain to an unlabeled target domain. UDA has proved its wide applicability in
    various vision tasks, for example, image classification and semantic segmentation.
    Despite its impressive success, the limitations of existing UDA methods lie in
    that: i) the consistency of the joint distribution in the target domain cannot
    be guaranteed by simply performing global feature alignment as in previous studies;
    ii) the context-dependency is essential for semantic segmentation, however, its
    transferability is still not well understood; iii) the robustness of UDA methods
    in semantic segmentation remains unexplored, which poses a security concern in
    this field; and iv) previous work is mainly built upon convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) to learn domain-invariant representations. However, the transferability
    of the Vision Transformer (ViT) which is convolution-free, is still an open problem.
    To address these limitations, in this dissertation: i) we use a reconstruction

  title: Node-aligned graph convolutional network for whole-slide image representation
    and classification
  authors:
  - Unknown Author
  date: '2022'
  venue: Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
  venueType: conference
  description: The large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs) facilitate the learning-based
    computational pathology methods. However, the gigapixel size of WSIs makes it
    hard to train a conventional model directly. Current approaches typically adopt
    multiple-instance learning (MIL) to tackle this problem. Among them, MIL combined
    with graph convolutional network (GCN) is a significant branch, where the sampled
    patches are regarded as the graph nodes to further discover their correlations.
    However, it is difficult to build correspondence across patches from different
    WSIs. Therefore, most methods have to perform non-ordered node pooling to generate
    the bag-level representation. Direct non-ordered pooling will lose much structural
    and contextual information, such as patch distribution and heterogeneous patterns,
    which is critical for WSI representation. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical
    global-to-local clustering strategy to build a Node-Aligned GCN (NAGCN) to represent
    WSI with rich local structural information as well as global distribution. We
    first deploy a global clustering operation based on the instance features in the
    dataset to build the correspondence across different WSIs. Then, we perform a
    local clustering-based sampling strategy to select typical instances belonging
    to each cluster within the WSI. Finally, we employ the graph convolution to obtain
    the representation. Since our graph construction strategy ensures the alignment
    among different WSIs, WSI-level representation can be easily generated and used
    for the subsequent classification. The experiment results on two cancer subtype
    classification datasets demonstrate our method achieves …

  venueType: conference
  description: Integration of heterogeneous and high-dimensional data (eg, multiomics)
    is becoming increasingly important. Existing multimodal classification algorithms
    mainly focus on improving performance by exploiting the complementarity from different
    modalities. However, conventional approaches are basically weak in providing trustworthy
    multimodal fusion, especially for safety-critical applications (eg, medical diagnosis).
    For this issue, we propose a novel trustworthy multimodal classification algorithm
    termed Multimodal Dynamics, which dynamically evaluates both the feature-level
    and modality-level informativeness for different samples and thus trustworthily
    integrates multiple modalities. Specifically, a sparse gating is introduced to
    capture the information variation of each within-modality feature and the true
    class probability is employed to assess the classification confidence of each
    modality. Then a transparent fusion algorithm based on the dynamical informativeness
    estimation strategy is induced. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
    work to jointly model both feature and modality variation for different samples
    to provide trustworthy fusion in multi-modal classification. Extensive experiments
    are conducted on multimodal medical classification datasets. In these experiments,
    superior performance and trustworthiness of our algorithm are clearly validated
    compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

  venueType: conference
  description: Vision-language representation learning largely benefits from image-text
    alignment through contrastive losses (eg, InfoNCE loss). The success of this alignment
    strategy is attributed to its capability in maximizing the mutual information
    (MI) between an image and its matched text. However, simply performing cross-modal
    alignment (CMA) ignores data potential within each modality, which may result
    in degraded representations. For instance, although CMA-based models are able
    to map image-text pairs close together in the embedding space, they fail to ensure
    that similar inputs from the same modality stay close by. This problem can get
    even worse when the pre-training data is noisy. In this paper, we propose triple
    contrastive learning (TCL) for vision-language pre-training by leveraging both
    cross-modal and intra-modal self-supervision. Besides CMA, TCL introduces an intra-modal
    contrastive objective to provide complementary benefits in representation learning.
    To take advantage of localized and structural information from image and text
    input, TCL further maximizes the average MI between local regions of image/text
    and their global summary. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work
    that takes into account local structure information for multi-modality representation
    learning. Experimental evaluations show that our approach is competitive and achieves
    the new state of the art on various common down-stream vision-language tasks such
    as image-text retrieval and visual question answering.

  description: Molecular property prediction is one fundamental yet challenging task

    the underlying data distribution is rarely explored. We discover that there exist

  venue: Advances in neural information processing systems
  venueType: other
  description: More recently, there has been a surge of interest in employing machine
    learning approaches to expedite the drug discovery process where virtual screening
    for hit discovery and ADMET prediction for lead optimization play essential roles.
    One of the main obstacles to the wide success of machine learning approaches in
    these two tasks is that the number of compounds labeled with activities or ADMET
    properties is too small to build an effective predictive model. This paper seeks
    to remedy the problem by transferring the knowledge from previous assays, namely
    in-vivo experiments, by different laboratories and against various target proteins.
    To accommodate these wildly different assays and capture the similarity between
    assays, we propose a functional rationalized meta-learning algorithm FRML for
    such knowledge transfer. FRML constructs the predictive model with layers of neural
    sub-networks or so-called functional regions. Building on this, FRML shares an
    initialization for the weights of the predictive model across all assays, while
    customizes it to each assay with a region localization network choosing the pertinent
    regions. The compositionality of the model improves the capacity of generalization
    to various and even out-of-distribution tasks. Empirical results on both virtual
    screening and ADMET prediction validate the superiority of FRML over state-of-the-art
    baselines powered with interpretability in assay relationship.

  venue: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems
  venueType: other
  description: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are promising deep learning approaches
    in learning representations for graph-structured data. Despite the proliferation
    of such methods, it is well known that they are vulnerable to carefully crafted
    adversarial attacks on the graph structure. In this paper, we first conduct an
    adversarial vulnerability analysis based on matrix perturbation theory. We prove
    that the low-frequency components of the symmetric normalized Laplacian, which
    is usually used as the convolutional filter in GCNs, could be more robust against
    structural perturbations when their eigenvalues fall into a certain robust interval.
    Our results indicate that not all low-frequency components are robust to adversarial
    attacks and provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between graph spectrum
    and robustness of GCNs. Motivated by the theory, we present GCN-LFR, a general
    robust co-training paradigm for GCN-based models, that encourages transferring
    the robustness of low-frequency components with an auxiliary neural network. To
    this end, GCN-LFR could enhance the robustness of various kinds of GCN-based models
    against poisoning structural attacks in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments
    across five benchmark datasets and five GCN-based models also confirm that GCN-LFR
    is resistant to the adversarial attacks without compromising on performance in
    the benign situation.

  description: Neural architecture search (NAS) has gained increasing attention in
    the community of architecture design. One of the key factors behind the success

    However, WS-based NAS methods often suffer from a performance disturbance (PD)

    learning, and contrastive learning are three different strategies for designing
    learning processes requiring less annotation cost. Semi-supervised learning and
    contrastive learning have been recently demonstrated to improve learning strategies
    that address datasets with noisy labels. Still, the inner connections between
    these fields as well as the potential to combine their strengths together have
    only started to emerge. In this paper, we explore further ways and advantages
    to fuse them. Specifically, we propose CSSL, a unified Contrastive Semi-Supervised
    Learning algorithm, and CoDiM (Contrastive DivideMix), a novel algorithm for learning
    with noisy labels. CSSL leverages the power of classical semi-supervised learning
    and contrastive learning technologies and is further adapted to CoDiM, which learns
    robustly from multiple types and levels of label noise. We show that CoDiM brings
    consistent improvements and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.

  description: Variants of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation learning
    have been proposed recently and achieved fruitful results in various fields. Among
    them, Graph Attention Network (GAT) first employs a self-attention strategy to
    learn attention weights for each edge in the spatial domain. However, learning
    the attentions over edges can only focus on the local information of graphs and
    greatly increases the computational costs. In this paper, we first introduce the
    attention mechanism in the spectral domain of graphs and present Spectral Graph
    Attention Network (SpGAT) that learns representations for different frequency
    components regarding weighted filters and graph wavelets bases. In this way, SpGAT
    can better capture global patterns of graphs in an efficient manner with much
    fewer learned parameters than that of GAT. Further, to reduce the computational
    cost of SpGAT brought by the eigen-decomposition …

  description: With massive possible synthetic routes in chemistry, retrosynthesis
    prediction is still a challenge for researchers. Recently, retrosynthesis prediction
    is formulated as a Machine Translation (MT) task. Namely, since each molecule
    can be represented as a Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES)
    string, the process of retrosynthesis is analogized to a process of language translation
    from the product to reactants. However, the MT models that applied on SMILES data
    usually ignore the information of natural atomic connections and the topology
    of molecules. To make more chemically plausible constrains on the atom representation

  description: The emergence of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has greatly boosted
    the progress of graph learning. However, two disturbing factors, noise and redundancy
    in graph data, and lack of interpretation for prediction results, impede further
    development of GCN. One solution is to recognize a predictive yet compressed subgraph
    to get rid of the noise and redundancy and obtain the interpretable part of the
    graph. This setting of subgraph is similar to the information bottleneck (IB)
    principle, which is less studied on graph-structured data and GCN. Inspired by

  date: 2021/7/1
  venue: International Conference on Machine Learning
  venueType: conference
  description: The surrogate that predicts the performance of hyperparameters has
    been a key component for sequential model-based hyperparameter optimization. In
    practical applications, a trial of a hyper-parameter configuration may be so costly
    that a surrogate is expected to return an optimal configuration with as few trials
    as possible. Observing that human experts draw on their expertise in a machine
    learning model by trying configurations that once performed well on other datasets,
    we are inspired to build a trial-efficient surrogate by transferring the meta-knowledge
    learned from historical trials on other datasets. We propose an end-to-end surrogate
    named as Transfer NeuralProcesses (TNP) that learns a comprehensive set of meta-knowledge,
    including the parameters of historical surrogates, historical trials, and initial
    configurations for other datasets. Experiments on extensive OpenML datasets and
    three computer vision datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves
    state-of-the-art performance in at least one order of magnitude less trials.

  description: 'In adversarial training (AT), the main focus has been the objective
    and optimizer while the model has been less studied, so that the models being
    used are still those classic ones in standard training (ST). Classic network architectures
    (NAs) are generally worse than searched NA in ST, which should be the same in
    AT. In this paper, we argue that NA and AT cannot be handled independently, since
    given a dataset, the optimal NA in ST would be no longer optimal in AT. That being
    said, AT is time-consuming itself; if we directly search NAs in AT over large
    search spaces, the computation will be practically infeasible. Thus, we propose
    diverse-structured network (DS-Net), to significantly reduce the size of the search
    space: instead of low-level operations, we only consider predefined atomic blocks,
    where an atomic block is a time-tested building block like the residual block.
    There are only a few atomic blocks and thus we can weight all atomic blocks rather
    than find the best one in a searched block of DS-Net, which is an essential tradeoff
    between exploring diverse structures and exploiting the best structures. Empirical
    results demonstrate the advantages of DS-Net, ie, weighting the atomic blocks.'

  venue: International conference on machine learning
  venueType: conference
  description: Meta-learning has proven to be a powerful paradigm for transferring
    the knowledge from previous tasks to facilitate the learning of a novel task.
    Current dominant algorithms train a well-generalized model initialization which
    is adapted to each task via the support set. The crux lies in optimizing the generalization
    capability of the initialization, which is measured by the performance of the
    adapted model on the query set of each task. Unfortunately, this generalization
    measure, evidenced by empirical results, pushes the initialization to overfit
    the meta-training tasks, which significantly impairs the generalization and adaptation
    to novel tasks. To address this issue, we actively augment a meta-training task
    with “more data” when evaluating the generalization. Concretely, we propose two
    task augmentation methods, including MetaMix and Channel Shuffle. MetaMix linearly
    combines features and labels of samples from both the support and query sets.
    For each class of samples, Channel Shuffle randomly replaces a subset of their
    channels with the corresponding ones from a different class. Theoretical studies
    show how task augmentation improves the generalization of meta-learning. Moreover,
    both MetaMix and Channel Shuffle outperform state-of-the-art results by a large
    margin across many datasets and are compatible with existing meta-learning algorithms.

  description: Temporal action localization, which requires a machine to recognize
    the location as well as the category of action instances in videos, has long been
    researched in computer vision. The main challenge of temporal action localization
    lies in that videos are usually long and untrimmed with diverse action contents
    involved. Existing state-of-the-art action localization methods divide each video
    into multiple action units (i.e., proposals in two-stage methods and segments
    in one-stage methods) and then perform action recognition/regression on each of
    them individually, without explicitly exploiting their relations during learning.
    In this paper, we claim that the relations between action units play an important
    role in action localization, and a more powerful action detector should not only
    capture the local content of each action unit but also allow a wider field of
    view on the context related to it. To this end, we propose a …

  description: Finding critical users whose existence keeps a social community cohesive
    and large is an important issue in social networks. In the literature, such criticalness
    of a user is measured by the number of followers who will leave the community
    together when the user leaves. By taking a social community as a -core, which

  venueType: arxiv
  description: 'Teaching Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to accurately classify nodes
    under severely noisy labels is an important problem in real-world graph learning
    applications, but is currently underexplored. Although pairwise training methods
    have demonstrated promise in supervised metric learning and unsupervised contrastive
    learning, they remain less studied on noisy graphs, where the structural pairwise
    interactions (PI) between nodes are abundant and thus might benefit label noise
    learning rather than the pointwise methods. This paper bridges the gap by proposing
    a pairwise framework for noisy node classification on graphs, which relies on
    the PI as a primary learning proxy in addition to the pointwise learning from
    the noisy node class labels. Our proposed framework PI-GNN contributes two novel
    components: (1) a confidence-aware PI estimation model that adaptively estimates
    the PI labels, which are defined as whether the two nodes share the same node
    labels, and (2) a decoupled training approach that leverages the estimated PI
    labels to regularize a node classification model for robust node classification.
    Extensive experiments on different datasets and GNN architectures demonstrate
    the effectiveness of PI-GNN, yielding a promising improvement over the state-of-the-art

  description: Accurate prediction of protein structures is critical for understanding
    the biological function of proteins. Nevertheless, most structure optimization
    methods are built upon pre-defined statistical energy functions, which may be

    graph neural network, with substantial modifications to embed the protein-specific

    as a novel sampling algorithm, and demonstrate that such process converges to
    native protein structures with theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments indicate
    that SE(3)-Fold achieves comparable structure optimization accuracy, compared
    against state-of-the-art baselines, with over 1-2 orders of magnitude speed-up.

  description: Valuation problems, such as feature interpretation, data valuation
    and model valuation for ensembles, become increasingly more important in many
    machine learning applications. Such problems are commonly solved by well-known
    game-theoretic criteria, such as Shapley value or Banzhaf value. In this work,
    we present a novel energy-based treatment for cooperative games, with a theoretical
    justification by the maximum entropy framework. Surprisingly, by conducting variational
    inference of the energy-based model, we recover various game-theoretic valuation
    criteria through conducting one-step fixed point iteration for maximizing the
    mean-field ELBO objective. This observation also verifies the rationality of existing
    criteria, as they are all attempting to decouple the correlations among the players
    through the mean-field approach. By running fixed point iteration for multiple
    steps, we achieve a trajectory of the valuations, among which we define the valuation
    with the best conceivable decoupling error as the Variational Index. We prove
    that under uniform initializations, these variational valuations all satisfy a
    set of game-theoretic axioms. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed
    Variational Index enjoys lower decoupling error and better valuation performance
    on certain synthetic and real-world valuation problems.

    novel algorithmic framework called \textit{graphon autoencoder} to build an interpretable
    and scalable graph generative model. This framework treats observed graphs as
    induced graphons in functional space and derives their latent representations
    by an encoder that aggregates Chebshev graphon filters. A linear graphon factorization
    model works as a decoder, leveraging the latent representations to reconstruct
    the induced graphons (and the corresponding observed graphs). We develop an efficient
    learning algorithm to learn the encoder and the decoder, minimizing the Wasserstein
    distance between the model and data distributions. This algorithm takes the KL
    divergence of the graph distributions conditioned on different graphons as the
    underlying distance and leads to a reward-augmented maximum likelihood estimation.
    The graphon autoencoder provides a new paradigm to represent and generate graphs,
    which has good generalizability and transferability.

  description: 'Nucleus instance segmentation and classification in histopathological
    images is an essential prerequisite in pathology diagnosis/prognosis. However,
    nucleus annotations (eg, segmentation and labeling) require domain experts, and
    annotating nuclei at pixel-level is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover,
    nuclei from different cancer types vary in shapes and appearances. These inter-cancer
    variations require careful annotations for specific cancer types. Therefore, to
    minimize the labeling cost, we propose a novel application that considers each
    cancer type as an individual domain and apply domain adaptation techniques to
    improve the segmentation/classification performance among different cancer types.
    Unlike the previous studies that focus on unsupervised or weakly-supervised domain
    adaptation independently, we would like to discover what kinds of labeling can
    achieve the most cost-effective domain adaptation performance in nucleus instance
    segmentation and classification. Specifically, we propose a unified framework
    that is applicable to different level annotations: no annotations, image-level,
    and point-level annotations. Cyclic adaptation with pseudo labels and adversarial
    discriminator are utilized for unsupervised domain alignment. Image-level or point-level
    annotations are additionally adopted to supervise the nucleus classification and

  description: Protein secondary structure prediction (PSSP) is an essential task
    in computational biology. To achieve the accurate PSSP, the general and vital
    feature engineering is to use multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for Position-Specific
    Scoring Matrix (PSSM) extraction. However, when only low-quality PSSM can be obtained
    due to poor sequence homology, previous PSSP accuracy (merely around 65%) is far
    from practical usage for subsequent tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel PSSM-Distil
    framework for PSSP on low-quality PSSM, which not only enhances the PSSM feature
    at a lower level but also aligns the feature distribution at a higher level. In
    practice, the PSSM-Distil first exploits the proteins with high-quality PSSM to
    achieve a teacher network for PSSP in a full-supervised way. Under the guidance
    of the teacher network, the low-quality PSSM and corresponding student network
    with low discriminating capacity are effectively resolved by feature enhancement
    through EnhanceNet and distribution alignment through knowledge distillation with
    contrastive learning. Further, our PSSM-Distil supports the input from a pre-trained
    protein sequence language BERT model to provide auxiliary information, which is
    designed to address the extremely low-quality PSSM cases, ie, no homologous sequence.
    Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed PSSM-Distil outperforms state-of-the-art
    models on PSSP by 6% on average and nearly 8% in extremely low-quality cases on
    public benchmarks, BC40 and CB513.

    are not well explored in existing MIL based studies. Inspired by the fact that
    pathologists jointly analyze visual fields at multiple powers of objective for
    diagnostic predictions, we propose a Pathologist-Tree Network (PTree-Net) to sparsely
    model the WSI efficiently in multi-scale manner. Specifically, we propose a Focal-Aware
    Module (FAM) that can approximately estimate diagnosis-related regions with an
    extractor trained using the thumbnail of WSI. With the initial diagnosis-related
    regions, we hierarchically model the multi-scale patches in a tree structure,
    where both the global and local information can be captured. To explore this tree
    structure in an end-to-end network, we propose a patch Relevance-enhanced Graph
    Convolutional Network (RGCN) to explicitly model the correlations of adjacent
    parent-child nodes, accompanied by patch relevance to exploit the implicit contextual
    information among distant nodes. In addition, tree-based self-supervision is devised
    to improve representation learning and suppress irrelevant instances adaptively.

  description: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) draw their strength from explicitly modeling
    the topological information of structured data. However, existing GNNs suffer
    from limited capability in capturing the hierarchical graph representation which
    plays an important role in graph classification. In this paper, we innovatively
    propose hierarchical graph capsule network (HGCN) that can jointly learn node
    embeddings and extract graph hierarchies. Specifically, disentangled graph capsules
    are established by identifying heterogeneous factors underlying each node, such
    that their instantiation parameters represent different properties of the same
    entity. To learn the hierarchical representation, HGCN characterizes the part-whole
    relationship between lower-level capsules (part) and higher-level capsules (whole)
    by explicitly considering the structure information among the parts. Experimental
    studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HGCN and the contribution of each component.

  description: In this article, we study the problem of guaranteed display ads (GDAs)
    allocation, which requires proactively allocate display ads to different impressions
    to fulfill their impression demands indicated in the contracts. Existing methods
    for this problem either assume the impressions that are static or solely consider

    scenario where the impressions are dynamical and large-scale, and the overall
    allocation optimality of all the considered GDAs is required. To bridge this gap,
    we formulate this problem as a sequential decision-making problem in the scope
    of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), by assigning an allocation agent
    to each ad and coordinating all the agents for allocating GDAs. The inputs are
    the states (e.g., the demands of the ad and the remaining time steps for displaying

  description: Accurate protein structure prediction from amino-acid sequences is
    critical to better understanding the protein function. Recent advances in this
    area largely benefit from more precise inter-residue distance and orientation
    predictions, powered by deep neural networks. However, the structure optimization
    procedure is still dominated by traditional tools, e.g. Rosetta, where the structure
    is solved via minimizing a pre-defined statistical energy function (with optional
    prediction-based restraints). Such energy function may not be optimal in formulating
    the whole conformation space of proteins. In this paper, we propose a fully-differentiable
    approach for protein structure optimization, guided by a data-driven generative
    network. This network is trained in a denoising manner, attempting to predict
    the correction signal from corrupted distance matrices between Ca atoms. Once
    the network is well trained, Langevin dynamics based sampling is adopted to gradually
    optimize structures from random initialization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
    that our EBM-Fold approach can efficiently produce high-quality decoys, compared
    against traditional Rosetta-based structure optimization routines.

  description: The development of effective therapies as well as early, molecular
    diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is impeded by the lack of understanding of the
    underlying pathological mechanisms. Metabolomics studies of body fluids as well
    as brain tissues have shown major changes in metabolic profiles of Alzheimer’s
    patients. However, with analysis performed at the late stages of the disease it
    is not possible to distinguish causes and consequence. The mouse model APP/PS1
    expresses a mutant amyloid precursor protein resulting in early Amyloid β (Aβ)
    accumulation as well as many resulting physiological changes including changes
    in metabolic profile and metabolism. Analysis of metabolic profile of cerebrospinal
    fluid (CSF) and blood of APP/PS1 mouse model can provide information about metabolic
    changes in these body fluids caused by Aβ accumulation. Using our novel method
    for analysis of correlation and mathematical ranking of significant correlations
    between metabolites in CSF and blood, we have explored changes in metabolite correlation
    and connectedness in APP/PS1 and wild type mice. Metabolites concentration and
    correlation changes in CSF, blood and across the blood brain barrier determined
    in this work are affected by the production of amyloid plaque. Metabolite changes
    observed in the APP/PS1 mouse model are the response to the mutation causing plaque
    formation, not the cause for the plaque suggesting that they are less relevant
    in the context of early treatment and prevention then the metabolic changes observed
    only in humans.

  description: 'Protein structure prediction has been a grand challenge for over 50
    years, owing to its broad scientific and application interests. There are two
    primary types of modeling algorithms, template-free modeling and template-based
    modeling. The latter one is suitable for easy prediction tasks and is widely adopted
    in computer-aided drug discoveries for drug design and screening. Although it
    has been several decades since its first edition, the current template-based modeling
    approach suffers from two critical problems: 1) there are many missing regions
    in the template-query sequence alignment, and 2) the accuracy of the distance
    pairs from different regions of the template varies, and this information is not
    well introduced into the modeling. To solve these two problems, we propose a structural
    optimization process based on template modeling, introducing two neural network
    models to predict the distance information of the missing regions and the accuracy
    of the distance pairs of different regions in the template modeling structure.
    The predicted distances and residue pairwise-specific deviations are incorporated

  description: 'Graph Neural Network (GNN) research is rapidly growing thanks to the
    capacity of GNNs in learning distributed representations from graph-structured
    data. However, centralizing a massive amount of real-world graph data for GNN
    training is prohibitive due to privacy concerns, regulation restrictions, and

    privacy. Despite recent advances in vision and language domains, there is no suitable
    platform for the FL of GNNs. To this end, we introduce FedGraphNN, an open FL

  description: Mitosis detection plays an import role in tumor grading of breast cancer.
    Automatic mitosis detection liberates pathologists from the time-consuming manual
    counting work. However, mitosis detection datasets are often provided only with
    centroid labels, limiting the performance of most deep learning methods. In this
    paper, we propose a novel method for mitosis detection to address this problem.
    First, we generate pixel-level labels directly from origin centroid labels with
    a gradient changing threshold approach. Then we apply a ResNet-based FCN to detect
    mitotic nuclei. Low confidence and tiny areas are removed from the prediction
    map to produce the final detections. By transforming the weak labels into strong
    labels, our method achieves F1-scores of 0.692, 0.608 and 0.805 on three public
    datasets, AMIDA 2013, ICPR 2014 and TUPAC 2016, respectively, outperforming all

  venueType: arxiv
  description: Given one or more query vertices, Community Search (CS) aims to find
    densely intra-connected and loosely inter-connected structures containing query
    vertices. Attributed Community Search (ACS), a related problem, is more challenging
    since it finds communities with both cohesive structures and homogeneous vertex
    attributes. However, most methods for the CS task rely on inflexible pre-defined
    structures and studies for ACS treat each attribute independently. Moreover, the
    most popular ACS strategies decompose ACS into two separate sub-problems, i.e.,
    the CS task and subsequent attribute filtering task. However, in real-world graphs,
    the community structure and the vertex attributes are closely correlated to each
    other. This correlation is vital for the ACS problem. In this paper, we propose
    Graph Neural Network models for both CS and ACS problems, i.e., Query Driven-GNN
    and Attributed Query Driven-GNN. In QD-GNN, we combine the local query-dependent
    structure and global graph embedding. In order to extend QD-GNN to handle attributes,
    we model vertex attributes as a bipartite graph and capture the relation between
    attributes by constructing GNNs on this bipartite graph. With a Feature Fusion
    operator, AQD-GNN processes the structure and attribute simultaneously and predicts
    communities according to each attributed query. Experiments on real-world graphs
    with ground-truth communities demonstrate that the proposed models outperform
    existing CS and ACS algorithms in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.
    More recently, an interactive setting for CS is proposed that allows users to
    adjust the predicted communities. We …

  description: Designing feasible and effective architectures under diverse computation
    budgets incurred by different applications/devices is essential for deploying
    deep models in practice. Existing methods often perform an independent architecture
    search for each target budget, which is very inefficient yet unnecessary. Moreover,
    the repeated independent search manner would inevitably ignore the common knowledge
    among different search processes and hamper the search performance. To address
    these issues, we seek to train a general architecture generator that automatically
    produces effective architectures for an arbitrary budget merely via model inference.
    To this end, we propose a Pareto-Frontier-aware Neural Architecture Generator
    (NAG) which takes an arbitrary budget as input and produces the Pareto optimal
    architecture for the target budget. We train NAG by learning the Pareto frontier
    (i.e., the set of Pareto optimal architectures) over model performance and computational
    cost (e.g., latency). Extensive experiments on three platforms (i.e., mobile,
    CPU, and GPU) show the superiority of the proposed method over existing NAS methods.

    computer-aided cancer diagnosis. However, due to the gigapixel dimension, WSIs
    are usually cropped into patches for analysis. Processing high-resolution patches
    independently may leave out the global geographical relationships and suffer slow
    inference speed while using low-resolution patches can enlarge receptive fields
    but lose local details. Here, we propose a Hierarchical Attention Guided (HAG)
    framework to address above problems. Particularly, our framework contains a global
    branch and several local branches to perform prediction at different scales. Additive
    hierarchical attention maps are generated by the global branch with sparse constraints
    to fuse multi-resolution predictions for better segmentation. During the inference,
    the sparse attention maps are used as the certainty guidance to select important
    local areas with a …

  description: The fusion of heterogeneous medical data is essential in precision
    medicine to assist medical experts in treatment decision-making. However, there
    is often little explicit correlation between data from different modalities such
    as histopathological images and tabular clinical data. Besides, attention-based
    multi-instance learning (MIL) often lacks sufficient supervision to assign appropriate
    attention weights for informative image patches and thus generates a good global
    representation for the whole image. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal
    multi-instance joint learning method, which fuses different modalities and magnification
    scales as a cross-modal representation to capture the potential complementary
    information and recalibrate the features in each modality. Furthermore, we leverage
    the information from tabular clinical data to optimize the MIL bag representation

  description: A large-scale labeled dataset is a key factor for the success of supervised
    deep learning in histopathological image analysis. However, exhaustive annotation
    requires a careful visual inspection by pathologists, which is extremely time-consuming

    to various downstream tasks with limited annotations. In this work, we propose
    a hybrid model (TransPath) which is pre-trained in an SSL manner on massively
    unlabeled histopathological images to discover the inherent image property and
    capture domain-specific feature embedding. The TransPath can serve as a collaborative

  description: 'Recent studies imply that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial
    examples, ie, inputs with a slight but intentional perturbation are incorrectly
    classified by the network. Such vulnerability makes it risky for some security-related
    applications (eg, semantic segmentation in autonomous cars) and triggers tremendous
    concerns on the model reliability. For the first time, we comprehensively evaluate
    the robustness of existing UDA methods and propose a robust UDA approach. It is
    rooted in two observations: i) the robustness of UDA methods in semantic segmentation
    remains unexplored, which poses a security concern in this field; and ii) although
    commonly used self-supervision (eg, rotation and jigsaw) benefits model robustness
    in classification and recognition tasks, they fail to provide the critical supervision
    signals that are essential in semantic segmentation. These observations motivate
    us to propose adversarial self-supervision UDA (or ASSUDA) that maximizes the
    agreement between clean images and their adversarial examples by a contrastive
    loss in the output space. Extensive empirical studies on commonly used benchmarks
    demonstrate that ASSUDA is resistant to adversarial attacks.'

  description: Given one or more query vertices, Community Search (CS) aims to find
    densely intra-connected and loosely inter-connected structures containing query
    vertices. Attributed Community Search (ACS), a related problem, is more challenging
    since it finds communities with both cohesive structures and homogeneous vertex
    attributes. However, most methods for the CS task rely on inflexible pre-defined
    structures and studies for ACS treat each attribute independently. Moreover, the
    most popular ACS strategies decompose ACS into two separate sub-problems, i.e.,
    the CS task and subsequent attribute filtering task. However, in real-world graphs,
    the community structure and the vertex attributes are closely correlated to each

  description: Integrating machine learning techniques into RDBMSs is an important
    task since many real applications require modeling (e.g., business intelligence,
    strategic analysis) as well as querying data in RDBMSs. Without integration, it
    needs to export the data from RDBMSs to build a model using specialized ML toolkits
    and frameworks, and import the model trained back to RDBMSs for further querying.
    Such a process is not desirable since it is time-consuming and needs to repeat
    when data is changed. In this paper, we provide an SQL solution that has the potential
    to support different ML models in RDBMSs. We study how to support unsupervised
    probabilistic modeling, that has a wide range of applications in clustering, density
    estimation, and data summarization, and focus on Expectation-Maximization (EM)
    algorithms, which is a general technique for finding maximum likelihood estimators.

    Vision
  venueType: conference
  description: In this paper, we consider the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation
    in the semantic segmentation. There are two primary issues in this field, ie,
    what and how to transfer domain knowledge across two domains. Existing methods
    mainly focus on adapting domain-invariant features (what to transfer) through
    adversarial learning (how to transfer). Context dependency is essential for semantic
    segmentation, however, its transferability is still not well understood. Furthermore,
    how to transfer contextual information across two domains remains unexplored.
    Motivated by this, we propose a cross-attention mechanism based on self-attention
    to capture context dependencies between two domains and adapt transferable context.
    To achieve this goal, we design two cross-domain attention modules to adapt context
    dependencies from both spatial and channel views. Specifically, the spatial attention
    module captures local feature dependencies between each position in the source
    and target image. The channel attention module models semantic dependencies between
    each pair of cross-domain channel maps. To adapt context dependencies, we further
    selectively aggregate the context information from two domains. The superiority
    of our method over existing state-of-the-art methods is empirically proved on"
    GTA5 to Cityscapes" and" SYNTHIA to Cityscapes".

  description: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a crucial factor in determining

  description: Precision medicine, regarded as the future of healthcare, is gaining
    increasing attention these years. As an essential part of precision medicine,
    clinical omics have been successfully applied in disease diagnosis and prognosis
    using machine learning techniques. However, existing methods mainly make predictions
    based on gene-level individual features or their random combinations, none of
    the previous work has considered the activation of signaling pathways. Therefore,
    the model interpretability and accuracy are limited, and reasonable signaling
    pathways are yet to be discovered. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level
    attention graph neural network (MLA-GNN), which applies weighted correlation network
    analysis (WGCNA) to format the omic data of each patient into graph-structured
    data, and then constructs multi-level graph features, and fuses them through a
    well-designed multi-level graph feature fully fusion (MGFFF) module to conduct
    multi-task prediction. Moreover, a novel full-gradient graph saliency mechanism
    is developed to make the MLA-GNN interpretable. MLA-GNN achieves state-of-the-art
    performance on transcriptomic data from TCGA-LGG/TCGA-GBM and proteomic data from
    COVID-19/non-COVID-19 patient sera. More importantly, the proposed model’s decision
    can be interpreted in the signaling pathway level and is consistent with the clinical
    understanding.

  description: Neural architecture search (NAS) has become an important approach to
    automatically find effective architectures. To cover all possible good architectures,
    we need to search in an extremely large search space with billions of candidate
    architectures. More critically, given a large search space, we may face a very
    challenging issue of space explosion. However, due to the limitation of computational
    resources, we can only sample a very small proportion of the architectures, which
    provides insufficient information for the training. As a result, existing methods
    may often produce sub-optimal architectures. To alleviate this issue, we propose
    a curriculum search method that starts from a small search space and gradually
    incorporates the learned knowledge to guide the search in a large space. With
    the proposed search strategy, our Curriculum Neural Architecture Search (CNAS)
    method significantly improves the search efficiency and finds better architectures
    than existing NAS methods. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate

  description: Detecting and localizing pathological region of interest (ROI) over
    whole slide pathological image (WSI) is a challenging problem. To reduce computational
    complexity, we introduced a two-stage superpixel-based ROI detection approach.
    To efficiently construct superpixels with fine details preserved, we utilized
    a novel superpixel clustering algorithm which cluster blocks of pixel in a hierarchical
    fashion. The major reduction of complexity is attributed to the combination of
    boundary update and coarse-to-fine refinement in superpixel clustering. The former
    maintains the accuracy of segmentation, meanwhile, avoids most of unnecessary
    revisit to the ‘non-boundary’pixels. The latter reduces the complexity by faster
    localizing those boundary blocks. Detector of RoI was trained using handcrafted
    features extracted from super-pixels of labeled WSIs. Extensive experiments indicates
    that the introduced superpixel clustering algorithm showed lifted accuracy on
    lung cancer WSI detection at much less cost, compared to other classic superpixel
    clustering approaches. Moreover, the clustered superpixels do not only facilitate
    a fast detection, also deliver a boundary-preserving segmentation of ROI in whole

  description: 'Recently, the teacher-student knowledge distillation framework has
    demonstrated its potential in training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However,
    due to the difficulty of training over-parameterized GNN models, one may not easily
    obtain a satisfactory teacher model for distillation. Furthermore, the inefficient
    training process of teacher-student knowledge distillation also impedes its applications
    in GNN models. In this paper, we propose the first teacher-free knowledge distillation
    method for GNNs, termed GNN Self-Distillation (GNN-SD), that serves as a drop-in
    replacement of the standard training process. The method is built upon the proposed
    neighborhood discrepancy rate (NDR), which quantifies the non-smoothness of the
    embedded graph in an efficient way. Based on this metric, we propose the adaptive
    discrepancy retaining (ADR) regularizer to empower the transferability of knowledge
    that maintains high neighborhood discrepancy across GNN layers. We also summarize
    a generic GNN-SD framework that could be exploited to induce other distillation
    strategies. Experiments further prove the effectiveness and generalization of
    our approach, as it brings: 1) state-of-the-art GNN distillation performance with

  description: 'Given the input graph and its label/property, several key problems
    of graph learning, such as finding interpretable subgraphs, graph denoising and
    graph compression, can be attributed to the fundamental problem of recognizing
    a subgraph of the original one. This subgraph shall be as informative as possible,
    yet contains less redundant and noisy structure. This problem setting is closely
    related to the well-known information bottleneck (IB) principle, which, however,
    has less been studied for the irregular graph data and graph neural networks (GNNs).
    In this paper, we propose a framework of Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) for
    the subgraph recognition problem in deep graph learning. Under this framework,
    one can recognize the maximally informative yet compressive subgraph, named IB-subgraph.
    However, the GIB objective is notoriously hard to optimize, mostly due to the
    intractability of the mutual information of irregular graph data and the unstable
    optimization process. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose: i) a GIB
    objective based-on a mutual information estimator for the irregular graph data;
    ii) a bi-level optimization scheme to maximize the GIB objective; iii) a connectivity
    loss to stabilize the optimization process. We evaluate the properties of the
    IB-subgraph in three application scenarios: improvement of graph classification,
    graph interpretation and graph denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
    the information-theoretic IB-subgraph enjoys superior graph properties.'

  date: 2020/9/29
  description: Mask-based annotation of medical images, especially for 3D data, is
    a bottleneck in developing reliable machine learning models. Using minimal-labor
    (UIs) to guide the annotation is promising, but challenges remain on best harmonizing
    the mask prediction with the UIs. To address this, we propose the user-guided
    domain adaptation (UGDA) framework, which uses prediction-based adversarial domain
    adaptation (PADA) to model the combined distribution of UIs and mask predictions.
    The UIs are then used as anchors to guide and align the mask prediction. Importantly,

  venueType: other
  description: To successfully train a cell segmentation network in fully-supervised
    manner for a particular type of organ or cancer, we need the dataset with ground-truth
    annotations. However, high unavailability of such annotated dataset and tedious
    labeling process enforce us to discover a way for training with unlabeled dataset.
    In this paper, we propose a network named CellSegUDA for cell segmentation on
    the unlabeled dataset (target domain). It is achieved by applying unsupervised
    domain adaptation (UDA) technique with the help of another labeled dataset (source
    domain) that may come from other organs or sources. We validate our proposed CellSegUDA
    on two public cell segmentation datasets and obtain significant improvement as
    compared with the baseline methods. Finally, considering the scenario when we
    have a small number of annotations available from the target domain, we extend
    our work to CellSegSSDA, a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) based approach.
    Our SSDA model also gives excellent results which are quite close to the fully-supervised
    upper bound in target domain.

  description: Molecule generation is to design new molecules with specific chemical
    properties and further to optimize the desired chemical properties. Following
    previous work, we encode molecules into continuous vectors in the latent space
    and then decode the embedding vectors into molecules under the variational autoencoder
    (VAE) framework. We investigate the posterior collapse problem of the current
    widely-used RNN-based VAEs for the molecule sequence generation. For the first
    time, we point out that the underestimated reconstruction loss of VAEs leads to
    the posterior collapse, and we also provide both analytical and experimental evidences
    to support our findings. To fix the problem and avoid the posterior collapse,
    we propose an effective and efficient solution in this work. Without bells and

  description: The overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
    has been established as a therapeutic target in multiple types of cancers, such
    as breast and gastric cancers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is employed as a basic
    HER2 test to identify the HER2-positive, borderline, and HER2-negative patients.
    However, the reliability and accuracy of HER2 scoring are affected by many factors,
    such as pathologists' experience. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been
    used in various disease diagnosis to improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability,
    but the interpretation of diagnosis results is still an open problem. In this
    paper, we propose a real-time HER2 scoring system, which follows the HER2 scoring
    guidelines to complete the diagnosis, and thus each step is explainable. Unlike
    the previous scoring systems based on whole-slide imaging, our HER2 scoring system
    is integrated into an augmented reality (AR) microscope that can feedback AI results
    to the pathologists while reading the slide. The pathologists can help select
    informative fields of view (FOVs), avoiding the confounding regions, such as DCIS.
    Importantly, we illustrate the intermediate results with membrane staining condition
    and cell classification results, making it possible to evaluate the reliability
    of the diagnostic results. Also, we support the interactive modification of selecting
    regions-of-interest, making our system more flexible in clinical practice. The
    collaboration of AI and pathologists can significantly improve the robustness
    of our system. We evaluate our system with 285 breast IHC HER2 slides, and the
    classification accuracy of 95\% shows the effectiveness of our …

  description: 'Many real data come in the form of non-grid objects, i.e. graphs,
    from social networks to molecules. Adaptation of deep learning from grid-alike

  authors:

  description: In transfer learning, what and where to transfer has been widely studied.
    Nevertheless, the learned transfer strategies are at high risk of over-fitting,
    especially when only a few annotated instances are available in the target domain.
    In this paper, we introduce the concept of transfer ensemble learning, a new direction
    to tackle the over-fitting of transfer strategies. Intuitively, models with different
    transfer strategies offer various perspectives on what and where to transfer.
    Therefore a core problem is to search these diversely transferred models for ensemble
    so as to achieve better generalization. Towards this end, we propose the Transferability
    Slider (TranSlider) for transfer ensemble learning. By decreasing the transferability,
    we obtain a spectrum of base models ranging from pure exploitation of the source
    model to unconstrained exploration for the target domain. Furthermore, the manner

  description: Within medical imaging, organ/pathology segmentation models trained
    on current publicly available and fully-annotated datasets usually do not well-represent
    the heterogeneous modalities, phases, pathologies, and clinical scenarios encountered

  description: Unsupervised domain adaptation enables to alleviate the need for pixel-wise

    to translate images from the source domain to the target domain and then align
    their marginal distributions in the feature space using adversarial learning.
    However, source-to-target translation enlarges the bias in translated images and
    introduces extra computations, owing to the dominant data size of the source domain.
    Furthermore, consistency of the joint distribution in source and target domains
    cannot be guaranteed through global feature alignment. Here, we present an innovative
    framework, designed to mitigate the image translation bias and align cross-domain
    features with the same category. This is achieved by 1) performing the target-to-source
    translation and 2) reconstructing both source and target images from their predicted

  venueType: arxiv
  description: 'Increasing the depth of GCN, which is expected to permit more expressivity,
    is shown to incur performance detriment especially on node classification. The
    main cause of this lies in over-smoothing. The over-smoothing issue drives the
    output of GCN towards a space that contains limited distinguished information
    among nodes, leading to poor expressivity. Several works on refining the architecture
    of deep GCN have been proposed, but it is still unknown in theory whether or not
    these refinements are able to relieve over-smoothing. In this paper, we first
    theoretically analyze how general GCNs act with the increase in depth, including
    generic GCN, GCN with bias, ResGCN, and APPNP. We find that all these models are
    characterized by a universal process: all nodes converging to a cuboid. Upon this
    theorem, we propose DropEdge to alleviate over-smoothing by randomly removing
    a certain number of edges at each training epoch. Theoretically, DropEdge either
    reduces the convergence speed of over-smoothing or relieves the information loss
    caused by dimension collapse. Experimental evaluations on simulated dataset have
    visualized the difference in over-smoothing between different GCNs. Moreover,
    extensive experiments on several real benchmarks support that DropEdge consistently
    improves the performance on a variety of both shallow and deep GCNs.'

  description: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown remarkable success
    in generating realistic data from some predefined prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian
    noises). However, such prior distribution is often independent of real data and
    thus may lose semantic information (e.g., geometric structure or content in images)
    of data. In practice, the semantic information might be represented by some latent
    distribution learned from data. However, such latent distribution may incur difficulties
    in data sampling for GAN methods. In this paper, rather than sampling from the
    predefined prior distribution, we propose a GAN model with local coordinate coding
    (LCC), termed LCCGAN, to improve the performance of the image generation. First,
    we propose an LCC sampling method in LCCGAN to sample meaningful points from the

    are obtained by a stick-breaking construction. The inference of iTM-VAE is modeled
    by neural networks such that it can be computed in a simple feed-forward manner.

    general and we show that it can be applied to other AEVB based models to alleviate
    the collapse-to-prior problem elegantly. Moreover, we also propose HiTM-VAE, where

  description: 'Graph Identification (GI) has long been researched in graph learning
    and is essential in certain applications (e.g. social community detection). Specifically,
    GI requires to predict the label/score of a target graph given its collection
    of node features and edge connections. While this task is common, more complex
    cases arise in practice---we are supposed to do the inverse thing by, for example,
    grouping similar users in a social network given the labels of different communities.
    This triggers an interesting thought: can we identify nodes given the labels of
    the graphs they belong to? Therefore, this paper defines a novel problem dubbed
    Inverse Graph Identification (IGI), as opposed to GI. Upon a formal discussion
    of the variants of IGI, we choose a particular case study of node clustering by
    making use of the graph labels and node features, with an assistance of a hierarchical
    graph that further characterizes the connections between different graphs. To
    address this task, we propose Gaussian Mixture Graph Convolutional Network (GMGCN),
    a simple yet effective method that makes the node-level message passing process
    using Graph Attention Network (GAT) under the protocol of GI and then infers the
    category of each node via a Gaussian Mixture Layer (GML). The training of GMGCN
    is further boosted by a proposed consensus loss to take advantage of the structure
    of the hierarchical graph. Extensive experiments are conducted to test the rationality
    of the formulation of IGI. We verify the superiority of the proposed method compared
    to other baselines on several benchmarks we have built up. We will release our

    infected millions of people and is still rapidly spreading all over the globe.
    Most COVID-19 patients suffer from lung infection, so one important diagnostic
    method is to screen chest radiography images, e.g., X-Ray or CT images. However,
    such examinations are time-consuming and labor-intensive, leading to limited diagnostic
    efficiency. To solve this issue, AI-based technologies, such as deep learning,
    have been used recently as effective computer-aided means to improve diagnostic
    efficiency. However, one practical and critical difficulty is the limited availability
    of annotated COVID-19 data, due to the prohibitive annotation costs and urgent
    work of doctors to fight against the pandemic. This makes the learning of deep
    diagnosis models very challenging. To address this, motivated by that typical

  venueType: conference
  description: Binary code similarity detection, whose goal is to detect similar binary
    functions without having access to the source code, is an essential task in computer
    security. Traditional methods usually use graph matching algorithms, which are
    slow and inaccurate. Recently, neural network-based approaches have made great
    achievements. A binary function is first represented as an control-flow graph
    (CFG) with manually selected block features, and then graph neural network (GNN)
    is adopted to compute the graph embedding. While these methods are effective and
    efficient, they could not capture enough semantic information of the binary code.
    In this paper we propose semantic-aware neural networks to extract the semantic
    information of the binary code. Specially, we use BERT to pre-train the binary
    code on one token-level task, one block-level task, and two graph-level tasks.
    Moreover, we find that the order of the CFG's nodes is important for graph similarity
    detection, so we adopt convolutional neural network (CNN) on adjacency matrices
    to extract the order information. We conduct experiments on two tasks with four
    datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-art
    models.

  description: Social media has been developing rapidly in public due to its nature
    of spreading new information, which leads to rumors being circulated. Meanwhile,
    detecting rumors from such massive information in social media is becoming an
    arduous challenge. Therefore, some deep learning methods are applied to discover
    rumors through the way they spread, such as Recursive Neural Network (RvNN) and
    so on. However, these deep learning methods only take into account the patterns
    of deep propagation but ignore the structures of wide dispersion in rumor detection.
    Actually, propagation and dispersion are two crucial characteristics of rumors.
    In this paper, we propose a novel bi-directional graph model, named Bi-Directional
    Graph Convolutional Networks (Bi-GCN), to explore both characteristics by operating
    on both top-down and bottom-up propagation of rumors. It leverages a GCN with
    a top-down directed graph of rumor spreading to learn the patterns of rumor propagation;

  description: 'With the great success of graph embedding model on both academic and
    industry area, the robustness of graph embedding against adversarial attack inevitably
    becomes a central problem in graph learning domain. Regardless of the fruitful
    progress, most of the current works perform the attack in a white-box fashion:
    they need to access the model predictions and labels to construct their adversarial
    loss. However, the inaccessibility of model predictions in real systems makes
    the white-box attack impractical to real graph learning system. This paper promotes
    current frameworks in a more general and flexible sense–we demand to attack various
    kinds of graph embedding model with black-box driven. To this end, we begin by
    investigating the theoretical connections between graph signal processing and
    graph embedding models in a principled way and formulate the graph embedding model
    as a general graph signal process with corresponding graph filter. As such, a
    generalized adversarial attacker: GF-Attack is constructed by the graph filter
    and feature matrix. Instead of accessing any knowledge of the target classifiers
    used in graph embedding, GF-Attack performs the attack only on the graph filter
    in a black-box attack fashion. To validate the generalization of GF-Attack, we
    construct the attacker on four popular graph embedding models. Extensive experimental
    results validate the effectiveness of our attacker on several benchmark datasets.
    Particularly by using our attack, even small graph perturbations like one-edge
    flip is able to consistently make a strong attack in performance to different
    graph embedding models.'

  description: Towards the challenging problem of semi-supervised node classification,
    there have been extensive studies. As a frontier, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
    have aroused great interest recently, which update the representation of each
    node by aggregating information of its neighbors. However, most GNNs have shallow
    layers with a limited receptive field and may not achieve satisfactory performance
    especially when the number of labeled nodes is quite small. To address this challenge,
    we innovatively propose a graph few-shot learning (GFL) algorithm that incorporates
    prior knowledge learned from auxiliary graphs to improve classification accuracy
    on the target graph. Specifically, a transferable metric space characterized by
    a node embedding and a graph-specific prototype embedding function is shared between
    auxiliary graphs and the target, facilitating the transfer of structural knowledge.
    Extensive experiments and ablation studies on four real-world graph datasets demonstrate
    the effectiveness of our proposed model and the contribution of each component.

  description: 'Portfolio Selection is an important real-world financial task and

    task, however, has two main difficulties: (i) the non-stationary price series
    and complex asset correlations make the learning of feature representation very
    hard; (ii) the practicality principle in financial markets requires controlling
    both transaction and risk costs. Most existing methods adopt handcraft features
    and/or consider no constraints for the costs, which may make them perform unsatisfactorily

    instability prediction based on histopathology images
  authors:

  venue: bioRxiv
  venueType: other
  description: 'Background

    Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a negative prognostic factor for colorectal
    cancer (CRC) and can be used as a predictor of success for immunotherapy in pan-cancer.
    However, current MSI identification methods are not available for all patients.
    We propose an ensemble multiple instance learning (MIL)-based deep learning model
    to predict MSI status directly from histopathology images.

    Design

    Two cohorts of patients were collected, including 429 from The Cancer Genome Atlas
    (TCGA-COAD) and 785 from a self-collected Asian data set (Asian-CRC). The initial
    model was developed and validated in TCGA-COAD, and then generalized in Asian-CRC
    through transfer learning. The pathological signatures extracted from the model
    are associated with genotypes for model interpretation.

    Results

    A model called Ensembled Patch Likelihood Aggregation (EPLA) was developed in
    the TCGA-COAD training set based on two consecutive stages: patch-level prediction
    and WSI-level prediction. The EPLA model achieved an area-under-the -curve (AUC)
    of 0.8848 in the TCGA-COAD test set, which outperformed the state-of-the-art approach,
    and an AUC of 0.8504 in the Asian-CRC after transfer learning. Furthermore, the
    five pathological imaging signatures identified using the model are associated
    with genomic and transcriptomic profiles, which makes the MIL model interpretable.
    Results show that our model recognizes pathological signatures related to mutation
    burden, DNA repair pathways, and immunity.

    Conclusion

    Our MIL-based deep learning model can effectively predict MSI from histopathology
    images and are transferable to a new …'

  description: 'Joint distribution matching (JDM) problem, which aims to learn bidirectional
    mappings to match joint distributions of two domains, occurs in many machine learning
    and computer vision applications. This problem, however, is very difficult due
    to two critical challenges: (i) it is often difficult to exploit sufficient information
    from the joint distribution to conduct the matching; (ii) this problem is hard
    to formulate and optimize. In this paper, relying on optimal transport theory,
    we propose to address JDM problem by minimizing the Wasserstein distance of the
    joint distributions in two domains. However, the resultant optimization problem
    is still intractable. We then propose an important theorem to reduce the intractable
    problem into a simple optimization problem, and develop a novel method (called
    Joint Wasserstein Distribution Matching (JWDM)) to solve it. In the experiments,
    we apply our method to unsupervised image translation and cross-domain video synthesis.
    Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the superior performance
    of our method over several state-of-the-arts.'

  description: How to obtain informative representations of molecules is a crucial
    prerequisite in AI-driven drug design and discovery. Recent researches abstract
    molecules as graphs and employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for task-specific
    and datadriven molecular representation learning. Nevertheless, two “dark clouds”
    impede the usage of GNNs in real scenarios:(1) insufficient labeled molecules
    for supervised training;(2) poor generalization capabilities to new-synthesized

    GROVER, which stands for Graph Representation frOm self-superVised mEssage passing

    any supervision, thus being immunized to the two issues mentioned above. We pre-train
    GROVER with 100 million parameters on 10 million unlabelled molecules—the biggest
    GNN and the largest training dataset that we have ever met. We then leverage the

    solving the combinations of three critical aspects of the problem:(1) it''s not

    because they are too large;(2) pre-trained parameters from other domains may not

    of the developed methods, I mainly focus on the primary and important applications

    making survival prediction from images by proposing a DeepConvSurv network, which
    integrates both the strengths of convolutional neural network and Cox proportional

  title: Deep multimodal fusion by channel exchanging
  authors:

  date: '2020'
  venue: Advances in neural information processing systems
  venueType: other
  description: Deep multimodal fusion by using multiple sources of data for classification
    or regression has exhibited a clear advantage over the unimodal counterpart on
    various applications. Yet, current methods including aggregation-based and alignment-based
    fusion are still inadequate in balancing the trade-off between inter-modal fusion
    and intra-modal processing, incurring a bottleneck of performance improvement.
    To this end, this paper proposes Channel-Exchanging-Network (CEN), a parameter-free
    multimodal fusion framework that dynamically exchanges channels between sub-networks
    of different modalities. Specifically, the channel exchanging process is self-guided
    by individual channel importance that is measured by the magnitude of Batch-Normalization
    (BN) scaling factor during training. The validity of such exchanging process is
    also guaranteed by sharing convolutional filters yet keeping separate BN layers
    across modalities, which, as an add-on benefit, allows our multimodal architecture
    to be almost as compact as a unimodal network. Extensive experiments on semantic
    segmentation via RGB-D data and image translation through multi-domain input verify
    the effectiveness of our CEN compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Detailed
    ablation studies have also been carried out, which provably affirm the advantage
    of each component we propose. Our code is available at https://github. com/yikaiw/CEN.

  description: Recent advances in neural architecture search inspire many channel
    number search algorithms~(CNS) for convolutional neural networks. To improve searching
    efficiency, parameter sharing is widely applied, which reuses parameters among
    different channel configurations. Nevertheless, it is unclear how parameter sharing
    affects the searching process. In this paper, we aim at providing a better understanding
    and exploitation of parameter sharing for CNS. Specifically, we propose affine
    parameter sharing~(APS) as a general formulation to unify and quantitatively analyze
    existing channel search algorithms. It is found that with parameter sharing, weight
    updates of one architecture can simultaneously benefit other candidates. However,
    it also results in less confidence in choosing good architectures. We thus propose
    a new strategy of parameter sharing towards a better balance between training
    efficiency and architecture discrimination. Extensive analysis and experiments
    demonstrate the superiority of the proposed strategy in channel configuration
    against many state-of-the-art counterparts on benchmark datasets.

  description: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have
    been widely used in modeling and generating graphs with latent factors. However
    there is no clear explanation of what these latent factors are and why they perform
    well. In this work, we present Dirichlet Graph Variational Autoencoder (DGVAE)
    with graph cluster memberships as latent factors. Our study connects VAEs based
    graph generation and balanced graph cut, and provides a new way to understand
    and improve the internal mechanism of VAEs based graph generation. Specifically,
    we first interpret the reconstruction term of DGVAE as balanced graph cut in a
    principled way. Furthermore, motivated by the low pass characteristics in balanced
    graph cut, we propose a new variant of GNN named Heatts to encode the input graph
    into cluster memberships. Heatts utilizes the Taylor series for fast computation
    of Heat kernels and has better low pass characteristics than Graph Convolutional
    Networks (GCN). Through experiments on graph generation and graph clustering,
    we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

  venue: Advances in neural information processing systems
  venueType: other
  description: Many approaches have been proposed for time series forecasting, in
    light of its significance in wide applications including business demand prediction.
    However, the existing methods suffer from two key limitations. Firstly, most point
    prediction models only predict an exact value of each time step without flexibility,
    which can hardly capture the stochasticity of data. Even probabilistic prediction
    using the likelihood estimation suffers these problems in the same way. Besides,
    most of them use the auto-regressive generative mode, where ground-truth is provided
    during training and replaced by the network’s own one-step ahead output during
    inference, causing the error accumulation in inference. Thus they may fail to
    forecast time series for long time horizon due to the error accumulation. To solve
    these issues, in this paper, we propose a new time series forecasting model--Adversarial
    Sparse Transformer (AST), based on Generated Adversarial Networks (GANs). Specifically,
    AST adopts a Sparse Transformer as the generator to learn a sparse attention map
    for time series forecasting, and uses a discriminator to improve the prediction
    performance from sequence level. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets
    show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

  description: Accurate predictions of protein structure properties, e.g. secondary
    structure and solvent accessibility, are essential in analyzing the structure
    and function of a protein. PSSM (Position-Specific Scoring Matrix) features are
    widely used in the structure property prediction. However, some proteins may have
    low-quality PSSM features due to insufficient homologous sequences, leading to
    limited prediction accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose an enhancing
    scheme for PSSM features. We introduce the “Bagging MSA” method to calculate PSSM
    features used to train our model, and adopt a convolutional network to capture
    local context features and bidirectional-LSTM for long-term dependencies, and
    integrate them under an unsupervised framework. Structure property prediction
    models are then built upon such enhanced PSSM features for more accurate predictions.

  description: 'Retrosynthesis is the process of recursively decomposing target molecules
    into available building blocks. It plays an important role in solving problems
    in organic synthesis planning. To automate or assist in the retrosynthesis analysis,
    various retrosynthesis prediction algorithms have been proposed. However, most
    of them are cumbersome and lack interpretability about their predictions. In this
    paper, we devise a novel template-free algorithm for automatic retrosynthetic
    expansion inspired by how chemists approach retrosynthesis prediction. Our method
    disassembles retrosynthesis into two steps: i) identify the potential reaction
    center of the target molecule through a novel graph neural network and generate
    intermediate synthons, and ii) generate the reactants associated with synthons
    via a robust reactant generation model. While outperforming the state-of-the-art
    baselines by a significant margin, our model also provides chemically reasonable
    interpretation.'

  description: 'Online Active Learning (OAL) aims to manage unlabeled datastream by
    selectively querying the label of data. OAL is applicable to many real-world problems,
    such as anomaly detection in health-care and finance. In these problems, there
    are two key challenges: the query budget is often limited; the ratio between classes
    is highly imbalanced. In practice, it is quite difficult to handle imbalanced
    unlabeled datastream when only a limited budget of labels can be queried for training.
    To solve this, previous OAL studies adopt either asymmetric losses or queries
    (an isolated asymmetric strategy) to tackle the imbalance, and use first-order
    methods to optimize the cost-sensitive measure. However, the isolated strategy
    limits their performance in class imbalance, while first-order methods restrict

  description: Recent image-based survival models rely on discriminative patch labeling,
    which are both time consuming and infeasible to extend to large scale cancer datasets.
    Different from the existing works on learning using key patches or clusters from
    WSIs, we take advantages of a deep multiple instance learning to encode all possible
    patterns from WSIs and consider the joint effects from different patterns for
    clinical outcomes prediction. We evaluate our model in its ability to predict
    patients’ survival risks across the Lung and Brain tumors from two large whole
    slide pathological images datasets. The proposed framework can improve the prediction
    performances compared with existing state-of-the-arts survival analysis approaches.
    Results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method as a recommender

  description: Deep learning (DL) has achieved remarkable performance on digital pathology
    image classification with whole slide images (WSIs). Unfortunately, high acquisition

  description: The human visual system tends to consider saliency of an object as
    a whole. Some object-level saliency detection methods have been proposed by leveraging
    object proposals in bounding boxes, and regarding the entire bounding box as one
    candidate salient region. However, the bounding boxes can not provide exact object
    position and a lot of pixels in bounding boxes belong to the background. Consequently,
    background pixels in bounding box also show high saliency. Besides, acquiring

  venueType: conference
  description: Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been successfully applied
    to multiple artificial intelligence areas and shows better performance compared
    with hand-designed networks. However, the existing NAS methods only target a specific
    task. Most of them usually do well in searching an architecture for single task
    but are troublesome for multiple datasets or multiple tasks. Generally, the architecture
    for a new task is either searched from scratch, which is neither efficient nor
    flexible enough for practical application scenarios, or borrowed from the ones
    searched on other tasks, which might be not optimal. In order to tackle the transferability
    of NAS and conduct fast adaptation of neural architectures, we propose a novel
    Transferable Neural Architecture Search method based on meta-learning in this
    paper, which is termed as T-NAS. T-NAS learns a meta-architecture that is able
    to adapt to a new task quickly through a few gradient steps, which makes the transferred
    architecture suitable for the specific task. Extensive experiments show that T-NAS
    achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot learning and comparable performance
    in supervised learning but with 50x less searching cost, which demonstrates the
    effectiveness of our method.

  description: \emph{Over-fitting} and \emph{over-smoothing} are two main obstacles
    of developing deep Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for node classification.
    In particular, over-fitting weakens the generalization ability on small dataset,
    while over-smoothing impedes model training by isolating output representations
    from the input features with the increase in network depth. This paper proposes
    DropEdge, a novel and flexible technique to alleviate both issues. At its core,
    DropEdge randomly removes a certain number of edges from the input graph at each
    training epoch, acting like a data augmenter and also a message passing reducer.
    Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that DropEdge either reduces the convergence
    speed of over-smoothing or relieves the information loss caused by it. More importantly,
    our DropEdge is a general skill that can be equipped with many other backbone
    models (e.g. GCN, ResGCN, GraphSAGE, and JKNet) for enhanced performance. Extensive
    experiments on several benchmarks verify that DropEdge consistently improves the
    performance on a variety of both shallow and deep GCNs. The effect of DropEdge
    on preventing over-smoothing is empirically visualized and validated as well.

  authors:
  - Unknown Author
  date: 2019/7/17
  venue: Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence
  venueType: conference
  description: One primary focus in multimodal feature extraction is to find the representations
    of individual modalities that are maximally correlated. As a well-known measure
    of dependence, the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi (HGR) maximal correlation be-comes
    an appealing objective because of its operational meaning and desirable properties.
    However, the strict whitening constraints formalized in the HGR maximal correlation
    limit its application. To address this problem, this paper proposes Soft-HGR,
    a novel framework to extract informative features from multiple data modalities.
    Specifically, our framework prevents the “hard” whitening constraints, while simultaneously
    preserving the same feature geometry as in the HGR maximal correlation. The objective
    of Soft-HGR is straightforward, only involving two inner products, which guarantees
    the efficiency and stability in optimization. We further generalize the framework
    to handle more than two modalities and missing modalities. When labels are partially
    available, we enhance the discriminative power of the feature representations
    by making a semi-supervised adaptation. Empirical evaluation implies that our
    approach learns more informative feature mappings and is more efficient to optimize.

  description: The recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to generate
    photo-realistic images by using neural networks and even to extrapolate video
    frames from an input video clip. In this paper, for the sake of both furthering
    this exploration and our own interest in a realistic application, we study imageto-video
    translation and particularly focus on the videos of facial expressions. This problem
    challenges the deep neural networks by another temporal dimension comparing to
    the image-to-image translation. Moreover, its single input image fails most existing
    video generation methods that rely on recurrent models. We propose a user-controllable
    approach so as to generate video clips of various lengths from a single face image.
    The lengths and types of the expressions are controlled by users. To this end,
    we design a novel neural network architecture that can incorporate the user input
    into its skip connections and propose several improvements to the adversarial
    training method for the neural network. Experiments and user studies verify the
    effectiveness of our approach. Especially, we would like to highlight that even
    for the face images in the wild (downloaded from the Web and the authors’ own
    photos), our model can generate high-quality facial expression videos of which
    about 50% are labeled as real by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers.

  venueType: arxiv
  description: Graph alignment, also known as network alignment, is a fundamental
    task in social network analysis. Many recent works have relied on partially labeled
    cross-graph node correspondences, i.e., anchor links. However, due to the privacy
    and security issue, the manual labeling of anchor links for diverse scenarios
    may be prohibitive. Aligning two graphs without any anchor links is a crucial
    and challenging task. In this paper, we propose an Unsupervised Adversarial Graph
    Alignment (UAGA) framework to learn a cross-graph alignment between two embedding
    spaces of different graphs in a fully unsupervised fashion (\emph{i.e.,} no existing
    anchor links and no users' personal profile or attribute information is available).
    The proposed framework learns the embedding spaces of each graph, and then attempts
    to align the two spaces via adversarial training, followed by a refinement procedure.
    We further extend our UAGA method to incremental UAGA (iUAGA) that iteratively
    reveals the unobserved user links based on the pseudo anchor links. This can be
    used to further improve both the embedding quality and the alignment accuracy.
    Moreover, the proposed methods will benefit some real-world applications, \emph{e.g.,}
    link prediction in social networks. Comprehensive experiments on real-world data
    demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches UAGA and iUAGA for unsupervised
    graph alignment.

  description: Bipartite graphs have been used to represent data relationships in
    many data-mining applications such as in E-commerce recommendation systems. Since
    learning in graph space is more complicated than in Euclidian space, recent studies
    have extensively utilized neural nets to effectively and efficiently embed a graph's
    nodes into a multidimensional space. However, this embedding method has not yet
    been applied to large-scale bipartite graphs. Existing techniques either cannot
    be scaled to large-scale bipartite graphs that have limited labels or cannot exploit
    the unique structure of bipartite graphs, which have distinct node features in
    two domains. Thus, we propose Cascade Bipartite Graph Neural Networks, Cascade-BGNN,
    a novel node representation learning for bipartite graphs that is domain-consistent,
    self-supervised, and efficient. To efficiently aggregate information both across
    and within the two partitions of a bipartite graph, BGNN utilizes a customized
    Inter-domain Message Passing (IDMP) and Intra-domain Alignment (IDA), which is
    our adaptation of adversarial learning, for message aggregation across and within
    partitions, respectively. BGNN is trained in a self-supervised manner. Moreover,
    we formulate a multi-layer BGNN in a cascaded training manner to enable multi-hop
    relationship modeling while improving training efficiency. Extensive experiments

    of BGNN over baselines. Our design is further affirmed through theoretical analysis

  description: In order to learn quickly with few samples, meta-learning utilizes
    prior knowledge learned from previous tasks. However, a critical challenge in
    meta-learning is task uncertainty and heterogeneity, which can not be handled
    via globally sharing knowledge among tasks. In this paper, based on gradient-based
    meta-learning, we propose a hierarchically structured meta-learning (HSML) algorithm
    that explicitly tailors the transferable knowledge to different clusters of tasks.
    Inspired by the way human beings organize knowledge, we resort to a hierarchical
    task clustering structure to cluster tasks. As a result, the proposed approach
    not only addresses the challenge via the knowledge customization to different
    clusters of tasks, but also preserves knowledge generalization among a cluster
    of similar tasks. To tackle the changing of task relationship, in addition, we
    extend the hierarchical structure to a continual learning environment. The experimental
    results show that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both
    toy-regression and few-shot image classification problems.

  description: Deep networks have achieved impressive performance in various domains,
    but their applications are largely limited by the prohibitive computational overhead.
    In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely collaborative channel pruning
    (CCP), to reduce the computational overhead with negligible performance degradation.
    The joint impact of pruned/preserved channels on the loss function is quantitatively
    analyzed, and such interchannel dependency is exploited to determine which channels
    to be pruned. The channel selection problem is then reformulated as a constrained
    0-1 quadratic optimization problem, and the Hessian matrix, which is essential
    in constructing the above optimization, can be efficiently approximated. Empirical
    evaluation on two benchmark data sets indicates that our proposed CCP algorithm
    achieves higher classification accuracy with similar computational complexity
    than other stateof-the-art channel pruning algorithms

  description: Fatorization machines (FM) are a popular model class to learn pairwise
    interactions by a low-rank approximation. Different from existing FM-based approaches
    which use a fixed rank for all features, this paper proposes a Rank-Aware FM (RaFM)
    model which adopts pairwise interactions from embeddings with different ranks.
    The proposed model achieves a better performance on real-world datasets where
    different features have significantly varying frequencies of occurrences. Moreover,
    we prove that the RaFM model can be stored, evaluated, and trained as efficiently
    as one single FM, and under some reasonable conditions it can be even significantly
    more efficient than FM. RaFM improves the performance of FMs in both regression
    tasks and classification tasks while incurring less computational burden, therefore

  description: Node classification and graph classification are two graph learning
    problems that predict the class label of a node and the class label of a graph
    respectively. A node of a graph usually represents a real-world entity, e.g.,
    a user in a social network, or a protein in a protein-protein interaction network.
    In this work, we consider a more challenging but practically useful setting, in
    which a node itself is a graph instance. This leads to a hierarchical graph perspective
    which arises in many domains such as social network, biological network and document
    collection. For example, in a social network, a group of people with shared interests
    forms a user group, whereas a number of user groups are interconnected via interactions

  venue: The 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics
  venueType: conference
  description: For constrained nonconvex minimization problems, we propose a meta
    stochastic projection-free optimization algorithm, named Normalized Frank Wolfe
    Updating, that can take any Gradient Estimator (GE) as input. For this algorithm,
    we prove its convergence rate, regardless of the choice of GE. Using a sophisticated
    GE, this algorithm can significantly improve the Stochastic First order Oracle
    (SFO) complexity. Further, a new second order GE strategy is proposed to incorporate
    curvature information, which enjoys theoretical advantage over the first order
    ones. Besides, this paper also provides a lower bound of Linear-optimization Oracle
    (LO) queried to achieve an approximate stationary point. Simulation studies validate
    our analysis under various parameter settings.

  venue: The 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics
  venueType: conference
  description: In this paper, we present a sample distributed greedy pursuit method
    for non-convex sparse learning under cardinality constraint. Given the training
    samples uniformly randomly partitioned across multiple machines, the proposed
    method alternates between local inexact sparse minimization of a Newton-type approximation
    and centralized global results aggregation. Theoretical analysis shows that for
    a general class of convex functions with Lipschitze continues Hessian, the method
    converges linearly with contraction factor scaling inversely to the local data
    size; whilst the communication complexity required to reach desirable statistical
    accuracy scales logarithmically with respect to the number of machines for some
    popular statistical learning models. For nonconvex objective functions, up to
    a local estimation error, our method can be shown to converge to a local stationary
    sparse solution with sub-linear communication complexity. Numerical results demonstrate
    the efficiency and accuracy of our method when applied to large-scale sparse learning
    tasks including deep neural nets pruning

  description: Colonoscopy has been widely applied as a common practice to inspect
    the inside of large bowel for colon cancer screening. However, missing polyps
    in such procedure could happen and thus preventing early disease detection and
    treatment. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for automatic polyp detection
    and localization in colonoscopy video. The method initially detects and localizes
    polyps based on single frame object detection or segmentation network such as
    U-Net. Then it utilizes optical flow to track polyps and fuse temporal information.
    To overcome tracking failure caused by motion effects, a motion regression model
    and an efficient on-the-fly trained CNN have been deployed. The proposed algorithm
    achieves the highest scores in both polyp detection task and polyp localization
    task in the MICCAI 2018 Endoscopic Vision Challenge on “Gastrointestinal Image

  description: Developing new deep learning methods for medical image analysis is
    a prevalent research topic in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a deep

    diagnosis. According to the Nottingham Grading System, mitotic count plays an
    important role in breast cancer diagnosis and grading. To determine the cancer
    grade, pathologists usually need to manually count mitosis from a great deal of
    histopathology images, which is a very tedious and time-consuming task. This paper
    proposes an automatic method for detecting mitosis. We regard the mitosis detection
    task as a semantic segmentation problem and use a deep fully convolutional network
    to address it. Different from conventional training data used in semantic segmentation
    system, the training label of mitosis data is usually in the format of centroid

  description: Factorization Machines (FMs) learn weights for feature interactions,
    and achieve great success in many data mining tasks. Recently, Locally Linear
    Factorization Machines (LLFMs) have been proposed to capture the underlying structures

  description: The communication overhead has become a significant bottleneck in data-parallel
    network with the increasing of model size and data samples. In this work, we propose
    a new algorithm LPC-SVRG with quantized gradients and its acceleration ALPC-SVRG
    to effectively reduce the communication complexity while maintaining the same
    convergence as the unquantized algorithms. Specifically, we formulate the heuristic
    gradient clipping technique within the quantization scheme and show that unbiased
    quantization methods in related works [3, 33, 38] are special cases of ours. We
    introduce double sampling in the accelerated algorithm ALPC-SVRG to fully combine
    the gradients of full-precision and low-precision, and then achieve acceleration
    with fewer communication overhead. Our analysis focuses on the nonsmooth composite
    problem, which makes our algorithms more general. The experiments on linear models
    and deep neural networks validate the effectiveness of algorithms.

  description: Prior knowledge of organ shape and location plays an important role
    in medical imaging segmentation. However, traditional 2D/3D segmentation methods
    usually operate as pixel-wise/voxel-wise classifiers where their training objectives
    are not able to incorporate the 3D shape knowledge explicitly. In this paper,
    we proposed an efficient deep shape-aware network to learn 3D geometry of the
    organ. More specifically, the network uses a 3D mesh representation in a graph-based
    CNN which can handle the shape inference and accuracy propagation effectively.
    After integrating the shape-aware module into the backbone FCNs and jointly training
    the full model in the multi-task framework, the discriminative capability of intermediate
    feature representations is increased for both geometry and segmentation regularizations

  description: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is widely used as a similarity measure in
    various domains. Due to its invariance against warping in the time axis, DTW provides
    more meaningful discrepancy measurements between two signals than other dis-tance
    measures. In this paper, we propose a novel component in an artificial neural
    network. In contrast to the previous successful usage of DTW as a loss function,
    the proposed framework leverages DTW to obtain a better feature extraction. For
    the first time, the DTW loss is theoretically analyzed, and a stochastic backpropogation
    scheme is proposed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the DTW learning.
    We also demonstrate that the proposed framework can be used as a data analysis
    tool to perform data decomposition.

  description: This paper studies Learning from Observations (LfO) for imitation learning
    with access to state-only demonstrations. In contrast to Learning from Demonstration
    (LfD) that involves both action and state supervisions, LfO is more practical
    in leveraging previously inapplicable resources (eg, videos), yet more challenging
    due to the incomplete expert guidance. In this paper, we investigate LfO and its
    difference with LfD in both theoretical and practical perspectives. We first prove
    that the gap between LfD and LfO actually lies in the disagreement of inverse
    dynamics models between the imitator and expert, if following the modeling approach
    of GAIL. More importantly, the upper bound of this gap is revealed by a negative
    causal entropy which can be minimized in a model-free way. We term our method
    as Inverse-Dynamics-Disagreement-Minimization (IDDM) which enhances the conventional
    LfO method through further bridging the gap to LfD. Considerable empirical results
    on challenging benchmarks indicate that our method attains consistent improvements
    over other LfO counterparts.

  description: Designing effective architectures is one of the key factors behind
    the success of deep neural networks. Existing deep architectures are either manually
    designed or automatically searched by some Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods.
    However, even a well-searched architecture may still contain many non-significant
    or redundant modules or operations (eg, convolution or pooling), which may not
    only incur substantial memory consumption and computation cost but also deteriorate
    the performance. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the operations inside an architecture
    to improve the performance without introducing extra computation cost. Unfortunately,
    such a constrained optimization problem is NP-hard. To make the problem feasible,
    we cast the optimization problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) and seek
    to learn a Neural Architecture Transformer (NAT) to replace the redundant operations
    with the more computationally efficient ones (eg, skip connection or directly
    removing the connection). Based on MDP, we learn NAT by exploiting reinforcement
    learning to obtain the optimization policies wrt different architectures. To verify
    the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, we apply NAT on both hand-crafted
    architectures and NAS based architectures. Extensive experiments on two benchmark
    datasets, ie, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrate that the transformed architecture
    by NAT significantly outperforms both its original form and those architectures
    optimized by existing methods.

  venueType: conference
  description: Most state-of-the-art action localization systems process each action
    proposal individually, without explicitly exploiting their relations during learning.
    However, the relations between proposals actually play an important role in action
    localization, since a meaningful action always consists of multiple proposals
    in a video. In this paper, we propose to exploit the proposal-proposal relations
    using GraphConvolutional Networks (GCNs). First, we construct an action proposal
    graph, where each proposal is represented as a node and their relations between
    two proposals as an edge. Here, we use two types of relations, one for capturing
    the context information for each proposal and the other one for characterizing
    the correlations between distinct actions. Then we apply the GCNs over the graph
    to model the relations among different proposals and learn powerful representations
    for the action classification and localization. Experimental results show that
    our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on THUMOS14 (49.1%
    versus 42.8%). Moreover, augmentation experiments on ActivityNet also verify the
    efficacy of modeling action proposal relationships.

    such as the evaluation of surgical instrument usage and automatic surgical report

  venue: Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition
  venueType: conference
  description: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) transfers knowledge from a label-rich
    source domain to a fully-unlabeled target domain. To tackle this task, recent
    approaches resort to discriminative domain transfer in virtue of pseudo-labels
    to enforce the class-level distribution alignment across the source and target
    domains. These methods, however, are vulnerable to the error accumulation and
    thus incapable of preserving cross-domain category consistency, as the pseudo-labeling
    accuracy is not guaranteed explicitly. In this paper, we propose the Progressive
    Feature Alignment Network (PFAN) to align the discriminative features across domains
    progressively and effectively, via exploiting the intra-class variation in the
    target domain. To be specific, we first develop an Easy-to-Hard Transfer Strategy
    (EHTS) and an Adaptive Prototype Alignment (APA) step to train our model iteratively
    and alternatively. Moreover, upon observing that a good domain adaptation usually
    requires a non-saturated source classifier, we consider a simple yet efficient
    way to retard the convergence speed of the source classification loss by further
    involving a temperature variate into the soft-max function. The extensive experimental
    results reveal that the proposed PFAN exceeds the state-of-the-art performance
    on three UDA datasets.

  description: 'Channel pruning is one of the predominant approaches for deep model
    compression. Existing pruning methods either train from scratch with sparsity
    constraints on channels, or minimize the reconstruction error between the pre-trained
    feature maps and the compressed ones. Both strategies suffer from some limitations:
    the former kind is computationally expensive and difficult to converge, whilst
    the latter kind optimizes the reconstruction error but ignores the discriminative
    power of channels. To overcome these drawbacks, we investigate a simple-yet-effective
    method, called discrimination-aware channel pruning, to choose those channels
    that really contribute to discriminative power. To this end, we introduce additional
    losses into the network to increase the discriminative power of intermediate layers
    and then select the most discriminative channels for each layer by considering
    the additional loss and the reconstruction error. Last, we propose a greedy algorithm
    to conduct channel selection and parameter optimization in an iterative way. Extensive
    experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For example, on ILSVRC-12,
    our pruned ResNet-50 with 30% reduction of channels even outperforms the original

  description: Deep neural networks have exhibited promising performance in image
    super-resolution (SR) due to the power in learning the non-linear mapping from
    low-resolution (LR) images to high-resolution (HR) images. However, most deep
    learning methods employ feed-forward architectures, and thus the dependencies
    between LR and HR images are not fully exploited, leading to limited learning
    performance. Moreover, most deep learning based SR methods apply the pixel-wise
    reconstruction error as the loss, which, however, may fail to capture high-frequency
    information and produce perceptually unsatisfying results, whilst the recent perceptual
    loss relies on some pre-trained deep model and they may not generalize well. In
    this paper, we introduce a mask to separate the image into low- and high-frequency
    parts based on image gradient magnitude, and then devise a gradient sensitive
    loss to well capture the structures in the image without sacrificing the recovery
    of low-frequency content. Moreover, by investigating the duality in SR, we develop
    a dual reconstruction network (DRN) to improve the SR performance. We provide
    theoretical analysis on the generalization performance of our method and demonstrate
    its effectiveness and superiority with thorough experiments.

  date: 2018/9/16
  description: Deep neural networks have been used in survival prediction by providing
    high-quality features. However, few works have noticed the significant role of
    topological features of whole slide pathological images (WSI). Learning topological
    features on WSIs requires dense computations. Besides, the optimal topological
    representation of WSIs is still ambiguous. Moreover, how to fully utilize the
    topological features of WSI in survival prediction is an open question. Therefore,
    we propose to model WSI as graph and then develop a graph convolutional neural
    network (graph CNN) with attention learning that better serves the survival prediction
    by rendering the optimal graph representations of WSIs. Extensive experiments
    on real lung and brain carcinoma WSIs have demonstrated its effectiveness.

  date: 2018/9/16
  description: Due to the popularity of smartphones and wearable devices nowadays,
    mobile health (mHealth) technologies are promising to bring positive and wide
    impacts on people’s health. State-of-the-art decision-making methods for mHealth
    rely on some ideal assumptions. Those methods either assume that the users are
    completely homogenous or completely heterogeneous. However, in reality, a user
    might be similar with some, but not all, users. In this paper, we propose a novel
    group-driven reinforcement learning method for the mHealth. We aim to understand
    how to share information among similar users to better convert the limited user
    information into sharper learned RL policies. Specifically, we employ the K-means
    clustering method to group users based on their trajectory information similarity
    and learn a shared RL policy for each group. Extensive experiment results have
    shown that our method can achieve …

  date: 2018/9/15
  description: This paper considers the actor-critic contextual bandit for the mobile
    health (mHealth) intervention. The state-of-the-art decision-making methods in
    the mHealth generally assume that the noise in the dynamic system follows the
    Gaussian distribution. Those methods use the least-square-based algorithm to estimate
    the expected reward, which is prone to the existence of outliers. To deal with
    the issue of outliers, we are the first to propose a novel robust actor-critic
    contextual bandit method for the mHealth intervention. In the critic updating,
    the capped- norm is used to measure the approximation error, which prevents outliers
    from dominating our objective. A set of weights could be achieved from the critic
    updating. Considering them gives a weighted objective for the actor updating.
    It provides the ineffective sample in the critic updating with zero weights for
    the actor updating. As a result, the robustness of both actor-critic …

  description: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have become a crucial tool on learning
    representations of graph vertices. The main challenge of adapting GCNs on large-scale
    graphs is the scalability issue that it incurs heavy cost both in computation
    and memory due to the uncontrollable neighborhood expansion across layers. In
    this paper, we accelerate the training of GCNs through developing an adaptive
    layer-wise sampling method. By constructing the network layer by layer in a top-down
    passway, we sample the lower layer conditioned on the top one, where the sampled
    neighborhoods are shared by different parent nodes and the over expansion is avoided
    owing to the fixed-size sampling. More importantly, the proposed sampler is adaptive
    and applicable for explicit variance reduction, which in turn enhances the training
    of our method. Furthermore, we propose a novel and economical approach to promote
    the message passing over distant nodes by applying skip connections. Intensive
    experiments on several benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method regarding
    the classification accuracy while enjoying faster convergence speed.

  description: In the wake of the vast population of smart device users worldwide,
    mobile health (mHealth) technologies are hopeful to generate positive and wide
    influence on people's health. They are able to provide flexible, affordable and
    portable health guides to devise users. Current online decision-making methods
    for mHealth assume that the users are completely heterogeneous. They share no
    information among users and learn a separate policy for each user. However, data
    for each user is very limited in size to support the separate online learning,
    leading to unstable policies that contain lots of variances. Besides, we find
    the truth that a user may be similar with some, but not all, users, and connected
    users tend to have similar behaviors. In this paper, we propose a network cohesion

  date: 2018/8/15
  description: Observing the recent progress in Deep Learning, the employment of AI
    is surging to accelerate drug discovery and cut R&D costs in the last few years.
    However, the success of deep learning is attributed to large-scale clean high-quality
    labeled data, which is generally unavailable in drug discovery practices. In this
    paper, we address this issue by proposing an end-to-end deep learning framework
    in a semi-supervised learning fashion. That is said, the proposed deep learning
    approach can utilize both labeled and unlabeled data. While labeled data is of
    very limited availability, the amount of available unlabeled data is generally
    huge. The proposed framework, named as seq3seq fingerprint, automatically learns
    a strong representation of each molecule in an unsupervised way from a huge training
    data pool containing a mixture of both unlabeled and labeled molecules. In the

  date: 2018/8/15
  description: Chest X-rays is one of the most commonly available and affordable radiological
    examinations in clinical practice. While detecting thoracic diseases on chest
    X-rays is still a challenging task for machine intelligence, due to 1) the highly
    varied appearance of lesion areas on X-rays from patients of different thoracic
    disease and 2) the shortage of accurate pixel-level annotations by radiologists
    for model training. Existing machine learning methods are unable to deal with
    the challenge that thoracic diseases usually happen in localized disease-specific
    areas. In this article, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning framework
    equipped with squeeze-and-excitation blocks, multi-map transfer and max-min pooling
    for classifying common thoracic diseases as well as localizing suspicious lesion
    regions on chest X-rays. The comprehensive experiments and discussions are performed

  description: 'This paper investigates Online Active Learning (OAL) for imbalanced

    work of OAL adopts either asymmetric losses or queries (an isolated asymmetric

  description: This paper proposes a framework of L-BFGS based on the (approximate)
    second-order information with stochastic batches, as a novel approach to the finite-sum
    minimization problems. Different from the classical L-BFGS where stochastic batches
    lead to instability, we use a smooth estimate for the evaluations of the gradient
    differences while achieving acceleration by well-scaling the initial Hessians.
    We provide theoretical analyses for both convex and nonconvex cases. In addition,
    we demonstrate that within the popular applications of least-square and cross-entropy
    losses, the algorithm admits a simple implementation in the distributed environment.
    Numerical experiments support the efficiency of our algorithms.

  venueType: conference
  description: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) aim to generate realistic data
    from some prior distribution (eg, Gaussian noises). However, such prior distribution
    is often independent of real data and thus may lose semantic information (eg,
    geometric structure or content in images) of data. In practice, the semantic information
    might be represented by some latent distribution learned from data, which, however,
    is hard to be used for sampling in GANs. In this paper, rather than sampling from
    the pre-defined prior distribution, we propose a Local Coordinate Coding (LCC)
    based sampling method to improve GANs. We derive a generalization bound for LCC
    based GANs and prove that a small dimensional input is sufficient to achieve good
    generalization. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate
    the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  description: 'In transfer learning, what and how to transfer are two primary issues
    to be addressed, as different transfer learning algorithms applied between a source
    and a target domain result in different knowledge transferred and thereby the
    performance improvement in the target domain. Determining the optimal one that
    maximizes the performance improvement requires either exhaustive exploration or
    considerable expertise. Meanwhile, it is widely accepted in educational psychology
    that human beings improve transfer learning skills of deciding what to transfer
    through meta-cognitive reflection on inductive transfer learning practices. Motivated
    by this, we propose a novel transfer learning framework known as Learning to Transfer
    (L2T) to automatically determine what and how to transfer are the best by leveraging
    previous transfer learning experiences. We establish the L2T framework in two
    stages: 1) we learn a reflection function encrypting transfer learning skills
    from experiences; and 2) we infer what and how to transfer are the best for a
    future pair of domains by optimizing the reflection function. We also theoretically

  description: Topic modeling of text documents is one of the most important tasks
    in representation learning. In this work, we propose iTM-VAE, which is a Bayesian
    nonparametric (BNP) topic model with variational auto-encoders. On one hand, as
    a BNP topic model, iTM-VAE potentially has infinite topics and can adapt the topic
    number to data automatically. On the other hand, different with the other BNP
    topic models, the inference of iTM-VAE is modeled by neural networks, which has
    rich representation capacity and can be computed in a simple feed-forward manner.
    Two variants of iTM-VAE are also proposed in this paper, where iTM-VAE-Prod models
    the generative process in products-of-experts fashion for better performance and
    iTM-VAE-G places a prior over the concentration parameter such that the model
    can adapt a suitable concentration parameter to data automatically. Experimental
    results on 20News and Reuters RCV1-V2 datasets show that the proposed models outperform
    the state-of-the-arts in terms of perplexity, topic coherence and document retrieval
    tasks. Moreover, the ability of adjusting the concentration parameter to data
    is also confirmed by experiments.

    norm (NN) regularization, the TVNNR model can utilize both spatial and temporal

  description: With the recent advancement of the deep learning technology in the
    artificial intelligence area, nowadays people's lives have been drastically changed.
    However, the success of deep learning technology mostly relies on large-scale
    high-quality data-sets. The complexity of deeper model and larger scale datasets
    have brought us significant challenges. Inspired by this trend, in this dissertation,
    we focus on developing efficient and effective large-scale deep learning techniques
    in solving real-world problems, like cell detection in hyper-resolution medical
    image or drug screening from millions of compound candidates. With respect to
    the hyper-resolution medical imaging cell detection problem, the challenges are
    mainly the extremely large scale pixel information. Also the cell density in the
    region of interests are usually super high, meaning that the cells will clump

  description: 'In transfer learning, what and how to transfer are two primary issues
    to be addressed, as different transfer learning algorithms applied between a source
    and a target domain result in different knowledge transferred and thereby the
    performance improvement in the target domain. Determining the optimal one that
    maximizes the performance improvement requires either exhaustive exploration or
    considerable expertise. Meanwhile, it is widely accepted in educational psychology
    that human beings improve transfer learning skills of deciding what to transfer
    through meta-cognitive reflection on inductive transfer learning practices. Motivated
    by this, we propose a novel transfer learning framework known as Learning to Transfer
    (L2T) to automatically determine what and how to transfer are the best by leveraging
    previous transfer learning experiences. We establish the L2T framework in two
    stages: 1) we learn a reflection function encrypting transfer learning skills
    from experiences; and 2) we infer what and how to transfer are the best for a
    future pair of domains by optimizing the reflection function. We also theoretically
    analyse the algorithmic stability and generalization bound of L2T, and empirically
    demonstrate its superiority over several state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.

  description: 'For model compression algorithms, there are several hyper-parameters
    that may have a large impact on the final compressed model''s performance. It
    can be quite difficult to manually determine proper values for these hyper-parameters,
    especially for developers that are not very familiar with algorithm details. Recently,
    several AutoML systems, eg Cloud AutoML from Google, have been developed to train
    high-quality machine learning models with minimal human effort. Particularly,
    the AMC algorithm (He et al., 2018) presents promising results for adopting reinforcement
    learning for automated model compression with channel pruning and fine-grained
    pruning.

    In PocketFlow, we introduce the hyper-parameter optimizer module to iteratively
    search for the optimal hyper-parameter setting. We provide several implementations
    of hyper-parameter optimizer, based on models including Gaussian Processes (GP,
    Mockus, 1975), Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE, Bergstra et al., 2013),
    and Deterministic Deep Policy Gradients (DDPG, Lillicrap et al., 2016). The hyper-parameter
    setting is optimized through an iterative process. In each iteration, the hyper-parameter
    optimizer chooses a combination of hyper-parameter values, and the learner generates
    a candidate model with fast fast-tuning. The candidate model is evaluated to calculate
    the reward of the current hyper-parameter setting. After that, the hyper-parameter
    optimizer updates its model to improve its estimation on the hyper-parameter space.
    Finally, when the best candidate model (and corresponding hyper-parameter setting)

  venueType: conference
  description: The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based region proposal generation
    method (ie region proposal network), trained using bounding box annotations, is
    an essential component in modern fully supervised object detectors. However, Weakly
    Supervised Object Detection (WSOD) has not benefited from CNN-based proposal generation
    due to the absence of bounding box annotations, and is relying on standard proposal
    generation methods such as selective search. In this paper, we propose a weakly
    supervised region proposal network which is trained using only image-level annotations.
    The weakly supervised region proposal network consists of two stages. The first
    stage evaluates the objectness scores of sliding window boxes by exploiting the
    low-level information in CNN and the second stage refines the proposals from the
    first stage using a region-based CNN classifier. Our proposed region proposal
    network is suitable for WSOD, can be plugged into a WSOD network easily, and can
    share its convolutional computations with the WSOD network. Experiments on the
    PASCAL VOC and ImageNet detection datasets show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art
    performance for WSOD with performance gain of about 3% on average.

  description: 'Dense event captioning aims to detect and describe all events of interest
    contained in a video. Despite the advanced development in this area, existing
    methods tackle this task by making use of dense temporal annotations, which is
    dramatically source-consuming. This paper formulates a new problem: weakly supervised
    dense event captioning, which does not require temporal segment annotations for
    model training. Our solution is based on the one-to-one correspondence assumption,
    each caption describes one temporal segment, and each temporal segment has one
    caption, which holds in current benchmark datasets and most real world cases.
    We decompose the problem into a pair of dual problems: event captioning and sentence
    localization and present a cycle system to train our model. Extensive experimental
    results are provided to demonstrate the ability of our model on both dense event
    captioning and sentence localization in videos.'

  venueType: conference
  description: Despite the recent success of end-to-end learned representations, hand-crafted
    optical flow features are still widely used in video analysis tasks. To fill this
    gap, we propose TVNet, a novel end-to-end trainable neural network, to learn optical-flow-like
    features from data. TVNet subsumes a specific optical flow solver, the TV-L1 method,
    and is initialized by unfolding its optimization iterations as neural layers.
    TVNet can therefore be used directly without any extra learning. Moreover, it
    can be naturally concatenated with other task-specific networks to formulate an
    end-to-end architecture, thus making our method more efficient than current multi-stage
    approaches by avoiding the need to pre-compute and store features on disk. Finally,
    the parameters of the TVNet can be further fine-tuned by end-to-end training.
    This enables TVNet to learn richer and task-specific patterns beyond exact optical
    flow. Extensive experiments on two action recognition benchmarks verify the effectiveness
    of the proposed approach. Our TVNet achieves better accuracies than all compared
    methods, while being competitive with the fastest counterpart in terms of features
    extraction time.

  description: Technological advances have created a great opportunity to provide
    multi-view data for patients. However, due to the large discrepancy between different

    multiple modalities data as well as learn very complex interactions that can affect

    Survival Model (DeepCorrSurv) for the integration of multi-view data. The proposed
    network consists of two sub-networks, view-specific and common sub-network. To
    remove the view discrepancy, the proposed DeepCorrSurv first explicitly maximizes
    the correlation among the views. Then it transfers feature hierarchies from view
    commonality and specifically fine-tunes on the survival regression task. Extensive

  description: Similarity measure is an essential component in image registration.
    In this article, we propose a novel similarity measure for registration of two

    with the separation of sparse errors. One of the key advantages of the proposed

    due to differences of acquisition modalities or illumination conditions. Two efficient

  description: Many of today's drug discoveries require expertise knowledge and insanely

    However, despite the growing interests of using supervised machine learning algorithms

  venueType: arxiv
  description: This paper considers the actor-critic contextual bandit for the mobile
    health (mHealth) intervention. The state-of-the-art decision-making methods in
    mHealth generally assume that the noise in the dynamic system follows the Gaussian
    distribution. Those methods use the least-square-based algorithm to estimate the
    expected reward, which is prone to the existence of outliers. To deal with the
    issue of outliers, we propose a novel robust actor-critic contextual bandit method
    for the mHealth intervention. In the critic updating, the capped- norm is used
    to measure the approximation error, which prevents outliers from dominating our
    objective. A set of weights could be achieved from the critic updating. Considering
    them gives a weighted objective for the actor updating. It provides the badly
    noised sample in the critic updating with zero weights for the actor updating.
    As a result, the robustness of both actor-critic updating is enhanced. There is
    a key parameter in the capped- norm. We provide a reliable method to properly
    set it by making use of one of the most fundamental definitions of outliers in
    statistics. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method can achieve
    almost identical results compared with the state-of-the-art methods on the dataset
    without outliers and dramatically outperform them on the datasets noised by outliers.

  description: Recently with the explosive growth of visual content on the Internet,
    large-scale image search has attracted intensive attention. It has been shown
    that mapping high-dimensional image descriptors to compact binary codes can lead
    to considerable efficiency gains in both storage and performing similarity computation

  description: In the wake of the vast population of smart device users worldwide,
    mobile health (mHealth) technologies are hopeful to generate positive and wide
    influence on people's health. They are able to provide flexible, affordable and
    portable health guides to device users. Current online decision-making methods
    for mHealth assume that the users are completely heterogeneous. They share no
    information among users and learn a separate policy for each user. However, data
    for each user is very limited in size to support the separate online learning,
    leading to unstable policies that contain lots of variances. Besides, we find
    the truth that a user may be similar with some, but not all, users, and connected
    users tend to have similar behaviors. In this paper, we propose a network cohesion
    constrained (actor-critic) Reinforcement Learning (RL) method for mHealth. The
    goal is to explore how to share information among similar users to better convert
    the limited user information into sharper learned policies. To the best of our
    knowledge, this is the first online actor-critic RL for mHealth and first network
    cohesion constrained (actor-critic) RL method in all applications. The network
    cohesion is important to derive effective policies. We come up with a novel method
    to learn the network by using the warm start trajectory, which directly reflects
    the users' property. The optimization of our model is difficult and very different
    from the general supervised learning due to the indirect observation of values.
    As a contribution, we propose two algorithms for the proposed online RLs. Apart
    from mHealth, the proposed methods can be easily applied or adapted to other health

  description: Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability and the second

    modality for acute stroke diagnosis. However when coupled with CT perfusion, the

    and prognosis has raised significant public concerns regarding its potential hazards

    proposed to reduce the necessary radiation dose in CT perfusion without comprising
    the image quality by fusing the information of the local anatomical structure
    with the temporal blood flow model. However the local search in the TTV framework
    fails to leverage the non-local information in the spatio-temporal data. In this

  description: 'Introduction

    Pathological examination of histopathological slides is a routine clinical procedure
    for lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Although the classification of lung cancer
    has been updated to become more specific, only a small subset of the total morphological
    features are taken into consideration. The vast majority of the detailed morphological
    features of tumor tissues, particularly tumor cells’ surrounding microenvironment,
    are not fully analyzed. The heterogeneity of tumor cells and close interactions
    between tumor cells and their microenvironments are closely related to tumor development
    and progression. The goal of this study is to develop morphological feature–based

    There is a large disparity between composite images based on image registration.

    or binding between nucleotides A-T and C-G, and the pairing rules are the molecule
    basis of genetic code. Unfortunately, no such rules have been discovered for proteins.
    Here we show that similar rules and intrinsic sequence patterns between intra-protein

    algorithm. Multi-millions of binding and non-binding peptide fragments from currently
    available protein X-ray structures are classified with an accuracy of up to 93%.
    This discovery has the potential in helping solve protein folding and protein-protein
    interaction problems, two open and fundamental problems in molecular biology.

  description: We propose a fast first-order method to solve multi-term nonsmooth
    composite convex minimization problems by employing a recent proximal average
    approximation technique and a novel adaptive parameter tuning technique. Thanks
    to this powerful parameter tuning technique, the proximal gradient step can be
    performed with a much larger stepsize in the algorithm implementation compared
    with the prior PA-APG method, which is the core to enable significant improvements
    in practical performance. Moreover, by choosing the approximation parameter adaptively,
    the proposed method is shown to enjoy the O (1/k) iteration complexity theoretically
    without needing any extra computational cost, while the PA-APG method incurs much
    more iterations for convergence. The preliminary experimental results on overlapping
    group Lasso and graph-guided fused Lasso problems confirm our theoretic claim
    well, and indicate that the proposed method is almost five times faster than the
    state-of-the-art PA-APG method and therefore suitable for higher-precision required
    optimization.

  description: Structured sparse learning has become a popular and mature research
    field. Among all structured sparse models, we found an interesting fact that most
    structured sparse properties could be captured by convolution operators, most
    famous ones being total variation and wavelet sparsity. This finding has naturally
    brought us to a generalization termed as Convolutional Sparsity. While this generalization
    bridges the convolution and sparse learning theory, we are able to propose a general,
    efficient, hyperparameter-free optimization algorithm framework for convolutional
    sparse models, thanks to the analysis theory of convolution operators. The convergence
    of the general, hyperparameter-free algorithm has been comprehensively analyzed,
    with a non-ergodic rate of O (1/ϵ 2) and ergodic rate of O (1/ϵ), where ϵ is the
    desired accuracy. Extensive experiments confirm the superior performance of our
    general algorithm in various convolutional sparse models, even better than some
    application-specialistic algorithms.

  description: Digital Pathology is a very promising approach to diagnostic medicine
    to accomplish better, faster prognosis and prediction of cancer. The high-resolution
    whole slide imaging (WSI) can be analyzed on any computer, easily stored, and
    quickly shared. However, a digital WSI is quite large, like over 1M pixels by
    1M pixels (3TB), depending on the tissue and the biopsy type. Automatic localization
    of regions of interest (ROIs) is important because it decreases the computational
    load and improves the diagnostic accuracy. Some popular applications in the market
    already support in viewing and marking the ROIs, such as ImageScope, OpenSlide,
    and ImageJ. However, it only shows some regions as a result and is hard to learn
    pathologists' behavior for future research and education. In this thesis, we propose
    a new automatic system, named as Auto-ROI, to automatically localize and extract
    diagnostically relevant ROIs from the pathologists' daily actions when they are
    viewing the WSI. Analyzing action information enables researchers to study pathologists'
    interpretive behavior and gain a new understanding of the diagnostic medical decision-making
    process. We compare the ROIs extracted by the proposed system with the ROIs marked
    by ImageScope in order to evaluate the accuracy. Experiment results show the Auto-ROI
    System can help to achieve a good performance in survival analysis.

  description: Pathology is a 150-year-old medical specialty that has seen a paradigm
    shift over the past few years with the advent of Digital Pathology. Digital Pathology
    is a very promising approach to diagnostic medicine to accomplish better, faster
    and cheaper diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of cancer and other important
    diseases. Historical approaches in Digital Pathology have focused primarily on
    low-level image analysis tasks (eg, color normalization, nuclear segmentation,
    and feature extraction) hence they are not generalized, thus not useful for practical
    use in clinical practices. In this thesis, a general Deep Learning based classification
    pipeline for identifying cancer metastases from histological images is proposed.
    GoogLeNet, a deep 27 layer Convolution Neural Network (ConvNet) is used to distinguish
    positive tumor areas from negative ones. The key challenge of detecting hard negative
    areas (areas surrounding tumor region) is tackled with ensemble learning method
    using two deep ConvNet models. Using dataset of the Camelyon'16 grand challenge,
    proposed pipeline achieved an area under the receiver operating curve (ROC) of
    92.57%, which beats the winning method of Camelyon'16 grand challenge, developed
    together by Harvard & MIT research labs. These results demonstrate the power of
    using deep learning to produce significant improvements in the accuracy of pathological
    diagnoses.

  authors:
  - Unknown Author
  date: '2017'
  venue: Advances in neural information processing systems
  venueType: other
  description: Linear Dynamical Systems (LDSs) are fundamental tools for modeling
    spatio-temporal data in various disciplines. Though rich in modeling, analyzing
    LDSs is not free of difficulty, mainly because LDSs do not comply with Euclidean
    geometry and hence conventional learning techniques can not be applied directly.
    In this paper, we propose an efficient projected gradient descent method to minimize
    a general form of a loss function and demonstrate how clustering and sparse coding
    with LDSs can be solved by the proposed method efficiently. To this end, we first
    derive a novel canonical form for representing the parameters of an LDS, and then
    show how gradient-descent updates through the projection on the space of LDSs
    can be achieved dexterously. In contrast to previous studies, our solution avoids
    any approximation in LDS modeling or during the optimization process. Extensive
    experiments reveal the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of
    the convergence and classification accuracy over state-of-the-art techniques.

  venueType: conference
  description: Image-based precision medicine techniques can be used to better treat
    cancer patients. However, the gigapixel resolution of Whole Slide Histopathological
    Images (WSIs) makes traditional survival models computationally impossible. These
    models usually adopt manually labeled discriminative patches from region of interests
    (ROIs) and are unable to directly learn discriminative patches from WSIs. We argue
    that only a small set of patches cannot fully represent the patients' survival
    status due to the heterogeneity of tumor. Another challenge is that survival prediction
    usually comes with insufficient training patient samples. In this paper, we propose
    an effective Whole Slide Histopathological Images Survival Analysis framework
    (WSISA) to overcome above challenges. To exploit survival-discriminative patterns
    from WSIs, we first extract hundreds of patches from each WSI by adaptive sampling
    and then group these images into different clusters. Then we propose to train
    an aggregation model to make patient-level predictions based on cluster-level
    Deep Convolutional Survival (DeepConvSurv) prediction results. Different from
    existing state-of-the-arts image-based survival models which extract features
    using some patches from small regions of WSIs, the proposed framework can efficiently
    exploit and utilize all discriminative patterns in WSIs to predict patients' survival
    status. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been shown before. We apply
    our method to the survival predictions of glioma and non-small-cell lung cancer
    using three datasets. Results demonstrate the proposed framework can significantly
    improve the prediction performance …

    way to bridge the gap between the supervised model with conditional Gaussian graphical

  description: Tracking Facial Points in unconstrained videos is challenging due to

    exploit incremental learning for person-specific alignment in wild conditions.
    Our approach takes advantage of part-based representation and cascade regression
    for robust and efficient alignment on each frame. Unlike existing methods that
    usually rely on models trained offline, we incrementally update the representation
    subspace and the cascade of regressors in a unified framework to achieve personalized
    modeling on the fly. To alleviate the drifting issue, the fitting results are
    evaluated using a deep neural network, where well-aligned faces are picked out
    to incrementally update the representation and fitting models. Both image and
    video datasets are employed to valid the proposed method. The results demonstrate
    the superior performance of our approach compared with existing approaches in

    key and challenging problems in mining such comprehensive heterogeneous image
    and genomic data, the PI proposes to develop novel large scale learning tools
    and explore ways to integrate features from multiple data sources for clinical
    outcome prediction. It will greatly support the Precision Medicine Initiative,

  venue: Magnetic resonance imaging

  description: Online imaging requires that the reconstruction of current frame only
    depends on the previous frames, and real time imaging is the desired case. In
    this work, we propose a novel scheme for real time dynamic magnetic resonance
    imaging (dMRI) reconstruction. Different from previous methods, the reconstructions
    of the second frame to the last frame are independent in our scheme, which only
    require the first frame as the reference image. Therefore, this scheme can be
    naturally implemented in parallel. After the first frame is reconstructed, all
    the later frames can be processed as soon as the k-space data are acquired. As
    an extension of the conventional spatial total variation, a new online model called
    dynamic total variation is used to exploit the sparsity on both spatial and temporal
    domains in dMRI. In real time dMRI, each frame is required to be reconstructed
    very fast. We then design a novel reweighted least …

  description: In this paper, we have proposed a framework for lung cancer survival
    prediction by integrating genetic data and pathological images. Since molecular
    profiles and pathological images reveal complementary information on tumor characteristics,
    the integration will benefit the survival analysis. The gene expression signatures

  venueType: conference
  description: In the past decades, Spectral Clustering (SC) has become one of the
    most effective clustering approaches. Although it has been widely used, one significant
    drawback of SC is its expensive computation cost. Many efforts have been devoted
    to accelerating SC algorithms and promising results have been achieved. However,
    most of the existing algorithms rely on the assumption that data can be stored
    in the computer memory. When data cannot fit in the memory, these algorithms will
    suffer severe performance degradations. In order to overcome this issue, we propose
    a novel sequential SC algorithm for tackling large-scale clustering with limited
    computational resources,\textit {eg}, memory. We begin with investigating an effective
    way of approximating the graph affinity matrix via leveraging a bipartite graph.
    Then we choose a smart graph construction and optimization strategy to avoid random
    access to data. These efforts lead to an efficient SC algorithm whose memory usage
    is independent of the number of input data points. Extensive experiments carried
    out on large datasets demonstrate that the proposed sequential SC algorithm is
    up to a thousand times faster than the state-of-the-arts.

    excellent subtype cell detection performance and our proposed subtype cell features

  description: 'Cancer, the second most dreadful disease causing large scale deaths
    in humans is characterized by uncontrolled growth of cells in the human body and
    the ability of those cells to migrate from the original site and spread to distant
    sites. The major proportion of deaths in cancer is due to improper primary diagnosis
    that raises the need for Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD). Digital Pathology is
    a technique that acts as second set of eyes to radiologists in delivering expert
    level preliminary diagnosis for cancer patients. Cell segmentation is a challenging
    step in digital pathology that identifies cell regions from micro-slide images
    and is fundamental for further process like classifying sub-type of tumors or
    survival prediction. Current techniques of cell segmentation rely on hand crafted
    features that are dependable on factors like image intensity, shape features,
    etc. Such computer vision based approaches have two main drawbacks: 1) these techniques
    might require several manual parameters to be set for accurate segmentation that
    puts burden on the radiologists. 2) Techniques based on shape or morphological
    features cannot be generalized as different types of cancer cells are highly asymmetric
    and irregular. In this thesis, Convolutional Networks, a supervised learning technique

  title: Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks for Pedestrian Detection
  authors:
  - Unknown Author
  date: '2016'
  description: Pedestrian Detection in real time has become an interesting and a challenging
    problem lately. With the advent of autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic
    monitoring systems, more time and money are being invested into detecting and
    locating pedestrians for their safety and towards achieving complete autonomy
    in vehicles. For the task of pedestrian detection, Convolutional Neural Networks
    (ConvNets) have been very promising over the past decade. ConvNets have a typical
    feed-forward structure and they share many properties with the visual system of
    the human brain. On the other hand, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are emerging
    as an important technique for image based detection problems and they are more
    closely related to the visual system due to their recurrent connections. Detecting
    pedestrians in a real time environment is a task where sequence is very important
    and it is intriguing to see how ConvNets and RNNs handle this task. This thesis
    hopes to make a detailed comparison between ConvNets and RNNs for pedestrian detection,
    how both these techniques perform on sequential pedestrian data, their scopes
    of research and what are their advantages and disadvantages. The comparison is
    done on two benchmark datasets-TUD-Brussels and ETH Pedestrian Datasets and a
    comprehensive evaluation is presented to see how research on these topics can
    be taken forward.

  description: Sequential face alignment, in essence, deals with non-rigid deformation
    that changes over time. In this paper, we propose to exploit incremental learning
    for person-specific alignment. Our approach takes advantage of part-based representation
    and cascade regression for robust and efficient alignment on each frame. More
    importantly, it incrementally updates the representation subspace and simultaneously
    adapts the cascade regressors in parallel using a unified framework. Person-specific
    modeling is eventually achieved on the fly while the drifting issue is significantly
    alleviated by erroneous detection using both part and holistic descriptors. Extensive
    experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate the superior
    performance of our approach compared with state of the arts in terms of fitting
    accuracy and efficiency.

  description: Recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of fusing information
    from multiple views for various machine learning applications. However, most existing
    approaches assumed the shared component common to all views and ignored the private
    components of individual views, which thereby restricts the learning performance.
    In this paper, we propose a new multi-view, low-rank, and sparse matrix decomposition
    scheme to seamlessly integrate diverse yet complementary information stemming
    from multiple views. Unlike previous approaches, our approach decomposes an input
    data matrix concatenated from multiple views as the sum of lowrank, sparse, and
    noisy parts. Then a unified optimization framework is established, where the lowrankness
    and group-structured sparsity constraints are imposed to simultaneously capture
    the shared and private components in both instance and view levels. A proven optimization
    algorithm is developed to solve the optimization, yielding the learned augmented
    representation which is used as features for classification tasks. Extensive experiments
    conducted on six benchmark image datasets show that our approach enjoys superior
    performance over the state-of-the-art approaches.

  description: The definition of the similarity measure is an essential component

    frequency domain, with the separation of a sparse tensor of errors. One of the
    key advantages of the proposed similarity measure is its robustness to severe
    intensity distortions, which widely exist on medical images, remotely sensed images

    conditions. Two efficient algorithms are proposed to solve the batch image registration

    arise due to motion and physiological artifacts, introducing errors into the cerebral
    blood flow estimation. We propose to recover the ASL-MRI data from the noisy and
    corrupted observations at shorter scanning time with a spatio-temporal low-rank
    total variation method. The low-rank approximation uses the similarity of the
    repetitive scans, and the total variation regularization considers the local spatial
    consistency. We compare with the state-of-art robust M-estimator for ASL cerebral
    blood flow map estimation. Validation on simulated and real data demonstrate the
    robustness of the proposed method at …

  venueType: conference
  description: In this paper, we address the problem of large-scale multi-view spectral
    clustering. In many real-world applications, data can be represented in various
    heterogeneous features or views. Different views often provide different aspects
    of information that are complementary to each other. Several previous methods
    of clustering have demonstrated that better accuracy can be achieved using integrated
    information of all the views than just using each view individually. One important
    class of such methods is multi-view spectral clustering, which is based on graph
    Laplacian. However, existing methods are not applicable to large-scale problem
    for their high computational complexity. To this end, we propose a novel large-scale
    multi-view spectral clustering approach based on the bipartite graph. Our method
    uses local manifold fusion to integrate heterogeneous features. To improve efficiency,
    we approximate the similarity graphs using bipartite graphs. Furthermore, we show
    that our method can be easily extended to handle the out-of-sample problem. Extensive
    experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
    and efficiency of the proposed method, where our method runs up to nearly 3000
    times faster than the state-of-the-art methods.

  description: Lung Cancer is one of the most serious diseases causing death for human
    be-ings. The progression of the disease and response to treatment di ers widely
    among patients. Thus it is very important to classify the type of tumor and also
    able to predict the clinical outcomes of patients. Majority of lung cancers is
    Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) which constitutes of 84% of all the type of
    lung cancers. The two major subtypes of NSCLC are Adenocarcinoma (ADC) and Squamous
    Cell Car-cinoma (SCC). Accurate classi cation of the lung cancer as NSCLC and
    its subtype classi cation is very important for quick diagnosis and treatment.
    In this research, a quantitative framework is proposed for one of the most challenging
    clinical case, the subtype recognition and classi cation of Non-Small Cell Lung
    Cancer (NSCLC) as Adenocarcinoma (ADC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC). The
    proposed frame-work made e ective use of both the holistic features and topological
    features which are extracted from whole slide histopathology images. The local
    features are extracted after using vigorous cell detection and segmentation so
    that every individual cell is segmented from the images. Then e cient geometry
    and texture descriptors which are based on the results of cell detection are used
    to extract the holistic features. We determined the topological properties from
    the labelled nuclei centroids to study into the potent of the topological features.
    The results of the experiments from popular classi ers show that the structure
    of the cells plays vital role and to di erentiate be-tween the two subtypes of
    NSCLC, the topological descriptors act as representative …

    sparsity both empirically and theoretically. Motivated by the special datasets

    is based on the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) framework, which converges
    exponentially fast. It is further accelerated by preconditioned conjugate gradient
    method with a well-designed preconditioner. Numerous experiments demonstrate the

    for a challenging and important clinical case in lung cancer, i.e., differentiation
    of two subtypes of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The proposed framework
    utilized both local and topological features from histopathology images. To extract

    to segment each individual cell in images. Then a set of extensive local features

    results. To investigate the effectiveness of topological features, we calculated
    architectural properties from labeled nuclei centroids. Experimental results from
    four popular classifiers suggest that the cellular structure is very important
    and the topological descriptors are representative markers to distinguish between
    two subtypes of NSCLC.

  description: Sparsity has been widely utilized in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
    to reduce k-space sampling. According to structured sparsity theories, fewer measurements
    are required for tree sparse data than the data only with standard sparsity. Intuitively,
    more accurate image reconstruction can be achieved with the same number of measurements
    by exploiting the wavelet tree structure in MRI. A novel algorithm is proposed
    in this article to reconstruct MR images from undersampled k-space data. In contrast
    to conventional compressed sensing MRI (CS-MRI) that only relies on the sparsity
    of MR images in wavelet or gradient domain, we exploit the wavelet tree structure
    to improve CS-MRI. This tree-based CS-MRI problem is decomposed into three simpler
    subproblems then each of the subproblems can be efficiently solved by an iterative
    scheme. Simulations and in vivo experiments demonstrate the significant …

  venueType: arxiv
  description: In this paper, we propose a novel method for image fusion with a high-resolution
    panchromatic image and a low-resolution multispectral image at the same geographical
    location. The fusion is formulated as a convex optimization problem which minimizes
    a linear combination of a least-squares fitting term and a dynamic gradient sparsity
    regularizer. The former is to preserve accurate spectral information of the multispectral
    image, while the latter is to keep sharp edges of the high-resolution panchromatic
    image. We further propose to simultaneously register the two images during the
    fusing process, which is naturally achieved by virtue of the dynamic gradient
    sparsity property. An efficient algorithm is then devised to solve the optimization
    problem, accomplishing a linear computational complexity in the size of the output
    image in each iteration. We compare our method against seven state-of-the-art
    image fusion methods on multispectral image datasets from four satellites. Extensive
    experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method substantially outperforms
    the others in terms of both spatial and spectral qualities. We also show that
    our method can provide high-quality products from coarsely registered real-world
    datasets. Finally, a MATLAB implementation is provided to facilitate future research.

  description: Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a noninvasive technique which measures
    hemodynamic changes in the tissue with near infrared light, which has been increasingly
    used to study brain functions. Due to the nature of light propagation in the tissue,
    the reconstruction problem is severely ill-posed. For linearized DOT problems,
    sparsity regularization has achieved promising results over conventional Tikhonov
    regularization in recent experimental research. As extensions to standard sparsity,
    it is widely known that structured sparsity based methods are often superior in
    terms of reconstruction accuracy, when the data follows some structures. In this

  description: Recently with the explosive growth of visual content on the Internet,
    large-scale image search has attracted intensive attention. It has been shown
    that mapping highdimensional image descriptors to compact binary codes can lead
    to considerable efficiency gains in both storage and similarity computation of
    images. However, most existing methods still suffer from expensive training devoted
    to large-scale binary code learning. To address this issue, we propose a sub-selection
    based matrix manipulation algorithm which can significantly reduce the computational
    cost of code learning. As case studies, we apply the sub-selection algorithm to
    two popular quantization techniques PCA Quantization (PCAQ) and Iterative Quantization
    (ITQ). Crucially, we can justify the resulting sub-selective quantization by proving
    its theoretic properties. Extensive experiments are carried out on three image
    benchmarks with up to one million samples, corroborating the efficacy of the sub-selective
    quantization method in terms of image retrieval.

    is a favorable model for this problem. For effectiveness of inference, two key
    assumptions are often adapted: independence of devices and the one-at-a-time condition
    (it assumes at most one device changes state at each time step). In this work,
    we argue that these assumptions in many cases do not hold in practical data. The
    contradiction of data and assumptions renders disaggregation problem particularly
    challenging. We attempt to address this problem by introducing a novel inference
    framework named Hierarchical FHMM that enables effective inference of FHMM when
    the assumptions are violated. This framework utilizes the relationship between
    devices to improve the speed and accuracy of inference. Our approach also has
    the advantage that it can be easily integrated with existing or future inference
    algorithms of FHMM. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, REDD and Pecan,
    demonstrated that our method yields state-of-the-art energy disaggregation results.'

  description: Feature matching is an important problem and has extensive uses in
    computer vision. However, existing feature matching methods support either a specific
    or a small set of transformation models. In this paper, we propose a unified feature
    matchingframework which supports a large family of transformation models. We call
    the family of transformation models the affine-functionfamily, in which all transformations
    can be expressed by affine functions with convex constraints. In this framework,
    the goal is to recover transformation parameters for every feature point in a
    template point set to calculate their optimal matching positions in an input image.
    Given pairwise feature dissimilarity values between all points in the template
    set and the input image, we create a convexdissimilarity function for each template
    point. Composition of such convex functions with any transformation model in the
    affine-function family is shown to …

  description: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance images are not only compressible
    but also share the same inter-spatial structure as they are scanned from the same
    anatomical cross section. In addition, the wavelet coefficients of a MR image
    naturally yield an intra-quadtree structure and has been used in compressed imaging.
    In this paper, we propose a new method to reconstruct multi-contrast MR images
    by exploiting their intra- and inter- structures simultaneously. Based on structured
    sparsity theory, it could further reduce the undersampled data for reconstruction
    or enhance the reconstruction quality. A new algorithm is proposed to efficiently
    solve this problem. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm
    over existing methods on multi-contrast MRI.

  description: Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) is a non-invasive technique which measures
    hemodynamic changes in the tissue with near infrared light, and has been increasingly
    used to study brain functions. Due to the nature of light propagation in the tissue,
    the reconstruction problem is severely ill-posed. Sparsity-regularization has
    achieved promising results in recent works for linearized DOI problem. In this
    paper, we exploit more prior information to improve DOI besides sparsity. Based
    on the functional specialization of the brain, the in vivo absorption changes
    caused by specific brain function can be clustered in certain region(s) and not
    randomly distributed. Thus, a new algorithm is proposed to utilize this prior
    in reconstruction. Results of numerical simulations and phantom experiments have
    demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art.

  description: In this paper, we investigate a new compressive sensing model for multi-channel
    sparse data where each channel can be represented as a hierarchical tree and different
    channels are highly correlated. Therefore, the full data could follow the forest
    structure and we call this property forest sparsity. It exploits both intra- and
    inter- channel correlations and enriches the family of existing model-based compressive
    sensing theories. The proposed theory indicates that only O(Tk+log(N/k)) measurements
    are required for multi-channel data with forest sparsity, where T is the number
    of channels, N and k are the length and sparsity number of each channel, respectively.
    This result is much better than O(Tk+Tlog(N/k)) of tree sparsity, O(Tk+klog(N/k))
    of joint sparsity, and far better than O(Tk+Tklog(N/k)) of standard sparsity.

  description: 'Invention Summary: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging has been widely
    used in medical diagnostics because of its non-invasive manner and excellent depiction
    of soft tissue changes. Image reconstruction methodologies are vital to many applications
    in medical imaging. Recent developments in compressive sensing theory show that
    it is possible to accurately reconstruct the Magnetic Resonance (MR) images from
    highly undersampled K-space data and therefore significantly reduce the scanning
    duration. Researchers at Rutgers University have developed a sparsity technique
    for efficient MR image segmentation and reconstruction. Sparsity is a way of looking
    at a small part of a video signal to develop a full image. It only works if it
    is the small, but significant part of the image. The method is akin to how human
    vision cannot process every detail but explores information in a small area of
    what the observer sees. The method mathematically allows reconstruction of a full
    image based on the sparse data set (ie: Reconstructing an MRI data set from sampled
    data along radial lines). The new MR image reconstruction method is based on the
    combination of variable and operator splitting techniques. The algorithm minimizes
    a linear combination of three terms corresponding to a least square data fitting,
    total variation (TV) and L1 norm regularization. This has been shown to be very
    powerful for the MR image reconstruction. First, the original problem is decomposed
    into L1 and TV norm regularization subproblems respectively. Then, these two subproblems
    are efficiently solved by existing techniques. Finally, the reconstructed image

  description: In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for structured sparsity

    (IRLS) framework, and accelerated by the preconditioned conjugate gradient method.
    The convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is almost the same as that of the
    traditional IRLS algorithms, that is, exponentially fast. Moreover, with the devised
    preconditioner, the computational cost for each iteration is significantly less
    than that of traditional IRLS algorithms, which makes it feasible for large scale
    problems. Besides the fast convergence, this algorithm can be flexibly applied
    to standard sparsity, group sparsity, and overlapping group sparsity problems.
    Experiments are conducted on a practical application compressive sensing magnetic
    resonance imaging. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior
    performance over 9 state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both accuracy and computational

  description: Robust visual tracking of instruments is an important task in retinal

    of appearance changes due to illumination and other changes during a procedure,

    to reinforce its model and become more robust over time. The performance of the

  venue: Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition
  venueType: conference
  description: In this paper, we propose a novel method for image fusion from a high
    resolution panchromatic image and a low resolution multispectral image at the
    same geographical location. Different from previous methods, we do not make any
    assumption about the upsampled multispectral image, but only assume that the fused
    image after downsampling should be close to the original multispectral image.
    This is a severely ill-posed problem and a dynamic gradient sparsity penalty is
    thus proposed for regularization. Incorporating the intra-correlations of different
    bands, this penalty can effectively exploit the prior information (eg sharp boundaries)
    from the panchromatic image. A new convex optimization algorithm is proposed to
    efficiently solve this problem. Extensive experiments on four multispectral datasets
    demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts
    in terms of both spatial and spectral qualities.

  description: This paper addresses the problem of facial landmark localization on

    fitting model for occluded landmark localization. Most recent shape registration
    methods apply landmark local search and attempt to simultaneously minimize both
    the model error and localization error. However, if part of the shape is occluded,
    those methods may lead to misalignment. In this paper, we introduce regression
    based occlusion detection to restrict the occluded landmarks' error propagation
    from passing to the overall optimization. Assuming the parameter model being Gaussian,
    we propose a weighted deformable fitting algorithm that iteratively approaches
    the optima. Experimental results in our synthesized facial occlusion database

    solved by existing techniques. Finally, the reconstructed image is obtained from
    the weighted average of solutions from two subproblems in an iterative framework.
    Experiments with improved performance over previous methods demonstrate the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm for compressed MR image reconstruction.

  description: The Metamorphs model is a robust segmentation method which integrates
    both shape and appearance in a unified space. The standard Metamorphs model does
    not encode temporal information. Thus it is not effective in segmenting time series
    data, such as a cardiac cycle from MRI. Furthermore, it needs manual interaction
    to initialize the model, which is time consuming for temporal data. In this paper,
    we proposed a model to seamlessly couple both spatial and temporal information
    together in the Metamorphs method. It is also able to automatically initialize
    the model instead of manual initialization. We model energy terms as probability
    maps, then different energy terms can be easily fused by multiplying them together.
    Temporal Spectral Residual (TSR) is employed to rapidly generate a probability
    map in temporal data. Compared to traditional Metamorphs, the computational overhead
    of our model is very light …

  description: Automatically assigning relevant text keywords to images is an important
    problem. Many algorithms have been proposed in the past decade and achieved good
    performance. Efforts have focused upon model representations of keywords, whereas
    properties of features have not been well investigated. In most cases, a group
    of features is preselected, yet important feature properties are not well used
    to select features. In this paper, we introduce a regularization-based feature
    selection algorithm to leverage both the sparsity and clustering properties of
    features, and incorporate it into the image annotation task. Using this group-sparsity-based
    method, the whole group of features [e.g., red green blue (RGB) or hue, saturation,
    and value (HSV)] is either selected or removed. Thus, we do not need to extract
    this group of features when new data comes. A novel approach is also proposed
    to iteratively obtain similar and …

  description: 'Parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging (pMRI) is a fast developing technique
    to reduce MR scanning time. In pMRI, multi-channel coils simultaneously receive
    a fraction of k-space data and the field of view (FOV) is then reconstructed with
    the coil profiles. The techniques for pMRI can be mainly divided in two groups:
    image domain techniques such as PILS, SENSE and Fourier domain techniques like
    SMASH and GRAPPA. In this paper, we propose a new method based on SENSE framework
    to reconstruct MR image from multi-coil data. The proposed method combines compressive
    sensing (CS) to further improve the acceleration rate and utilizes total variation
    and wavelet sparsity regularization to remove artifacts. Both reconstruction problems
    can be solved by a recent fastest algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed
    method outperforms all other previous methods under SENSE framework.'

  description: We address the problem of tracking human faces under various poses
    and lighting conditions. Reliable face tracking is a challenging task. The shapes
    of the faces may change dramatically with various identities, poses and expressions.
    Moreover, poor lighting conditions may cause a low contrast image or cast shadows
    on faces, which will significantly degrade the performance of the tracking system.
    In this paper, we develop a framework to track face shapes by using both color
    and depth information. Since the faces in various poses lie on a nonlinear manifold,
    we build piecewise linear face models, each model covering a range of poses. The
    low-resolution depth image is captured by using Microsoft Kinect, and is used
    to predict head pose and generate extra constraints at the face boundary. Our
    experiments show that, by exploiting the depth information, the performance of

  description: In Compressive Sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CS-MRI), one can
    reconstruct a MR image with good quality from only a small number of measurements.
    This can significantly reduce MR scanning time. According to structured sparsity
    theory, the measurements can be further reduced to for tree-sparse data instead
    of for standard -sparse data with length . However, few of existing algorithms
    has utilized this for CS-MRI, while most of them use Total Variation and wavelet
    sparse regularization. On the other side, some algorithms have been proposed for
    tree sparsity regularization, but few of them has validated the benefit of tree
    structure in CS-MRI. In this paper, we propose a fast convex optimization algorithm
    to improve CS-MRI. Wavelet sparsity, gradient sparsity and tree sparsity are all
    considered in our model for real MR images. The original complex problem is decomposed
    to three simpler subproblems then each of the subproblems can be efficiently solved
    with an iterative scheme. Numerous experiments have been conducted and show that
    the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art CS-MRI algorithms, and
    gain better reconstructions results on real MR images than general tree based
    solvers or algorithms.

  description: Deformable models provide a powerful tool for image analysis, which
    combines physics, geometry, and approximation theory. They exploit bottom-up constraints
    derived from the image observations together with top-down knowledge about the

    difference from the feature points. Also, note that L1 norm, which prefers sparse
    structure, would underestimate Gaussian noise. Therefore, it is combined with
    L2 norm to track the motion with both strong Gaussian noise and sparse outliers.

  description: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in many medical imaging applications
    by automatically locating the regions of interest. Typically supervised learning
    based segmentation methods require a large set of accurately labeled training
    data. However, thel labeling process is tedious, time consuming and sometimes
    not necessary. We propose a robust logistic regression algorithm to handle label
    outliers such that doctors do not need to waste time on precisely labeling images
    for training set. To validate its effectiveness and efficiency, we conduct carefully
    designed experiments on cervigram image segmentation while there exist label outliers.
    Experimental results show that the proposed robust logistic regression algorithms
    achieve superior performance compared to previous methods, which validates the
    benefits of the proposed algorithms.

  description: 'Organ shape plays an important role in various clinical practices,

    (1) shape variation is complex and cannot always be modeled by a parametric probability

    may have gross errors; and (3) local details of the input shape are difficult

  description: 3D parametric deformable models have been used to extract volumetric

    in some segmentation cases, such as cerebral cortex with complex folds and creases,
    and human lung with high curvature boundary, parametric deformable models often
    suffer from over-smoothing or decreased mesh quality during model deformation.
    To address this problem, we propose a 3D Laplacian-driven parametric deformable
    model with a new internal force. Derived from a Mesh Laplacian, the internal force
    exerted on each control vertex can be decomposed into two orthogonal vectors based
    on the vertex's tangential plane. We then introduce a weighting function to control

  description: This paper proposes a sparsity driven shape registration method for

    search landmark locations which comply both shape model and local image appearances.
    However, if the shape is partially occluded, the above goal is inappropriate and
    often leads to distorted shape results. In this paper, we introduce an error term
    to rectify the locations of the occluded landmarks. Under the assumption that
    occlusion takes a small proportion of the shape, we propose a sparse optimization
    algorithm that iteratively approaches the optimal shape. The experiments in our
    synthesized face occlusion database prove the advantage of our method.

  description: Appearance and shape are two key elements exploited in medical image
    segmentation. However, in some medical image analysis tasks, appearance cues are
    weak/misleading due to disease/artifacts and often lead to erroneous segmentation.
    In this paper, a novel deformable model is proposed for robust segmentation in
    the presence of weak/misleading appearance cues. Owing to the less trustable appearance
    information, this method focuses on the effective shape modeling with two contributions.
    First, a shape composition method is designed to incorporate shape prior on-the-fly.
    Based on two sparsity observations, this method is robust to false appearance
    information and adaptive to statistically insignificant shape modes. Second, shape
    priors are modeled and used in a hierarchical fashion. More specifically, by using
    affinity propagation method, our deformable surface is divided into multiple …

  description: In this paper, we propose a method to segment multiple rodent brain
    structures simultaneously. This method combines deformable models and hierarchical
    shape priors within one framework. The deformation module employs both gradient
    and appearance information to generate image forces to deform the shape. The shape
    prior module uses Principal Component Analysis to hierarchically model the multiple
    structures at both global and local levels. At the global level, the statistics
    of relative positions among different structures are modeled. At the local level,
    the shape statistics within each structure is learned from training samples. Our
    segmentation method adaptively employs both priors to constrain the intermediate
    deformation result. This prior constraint improves the robustness of the model
    and benefits the segmentation accuracy. Another merit of our prior module is that

  description: For the purpose of object boundary extraction, traditional shape-based
    deformable models rely on external image forces that come primarily from edge
    or image gradient information. Such reliance on local edge information makes the
    models prone to get stuck in local minima due to image noise and various other
    image artifacts. In this chapter, we review a 2D deformable model – Metamorphs,
    which integrates region texture constraints so as to achieve more robust segmentation.
    Compared with traditional shape-based models, Metamorphs segmentation result is
    less dependent on model initialization and not sensitive to noise and spurious
    edges inside the object of interest. Then, we review Active Volume Model (AVM),
    a similar and improved approach for 3D segmentation. The shape of this 3D model
    is considered as an elastic solid, with a simplex-mesh surface made of thousands
    of vertices. Deformations …

  description: 'Shape deformation and editing are important for animation and game

    Degenerated mesh may adversely affect the deformation performance. A preprocessing
    step of mesh optimization can alleviate this problem. However, skinny triangles
    can still be generated during deformation, which adversely affect the editing

  description: The sparse representation has been widely used in many areas and utilized
    for visual tracking. Tracking with sparse representation is formulated as searching
    for samples with minimal reconstruction errors from learned template subspace.
    However, the computational cost makes it unsuitable to utilize high dimensional
    advanced features which are often important for robust tracking under dynamic
    environment. Based on the observations that a target can be reconstructed from
    several templates, and only some of the features with discriminative power are
    significant to separate the target from the background, we propose a novel online
    tracking algorithm with two stage sparse optimization to jointly minimize the
    target reconstruction error and maximize the discriminative power. As the target
    template and discriminative features usually have temporal and spatial relationship,

  description: This paper investigates a new learning formulation called dynamic group

    the nonzero coefficients are often not random but tend to be clustered. Intuitively,

    to both sparsity and group clustering priors rather than only sparsity as in previous
    methods. The proposed algorithm can recover stably sparse data with clustering
    trends using far fewer measurements and computations than current state-of-the-art

    subspace in a higher dimension; 2) if a target (or test) image, aligned with the

    虹膜图像的配准是其中一个非常 重要的组成部分. 一般而言, 在拍摄虹膜图像过程中, 由于拍摄时间的不同或头部不可避免会轻微晃动, 眨眼引起眼皮移动, 眼睛随着光照强度变化的缩放特性等原因,
    不同时刻拍摄到的各帧虹膜图像之间不一定是一一对应的. 在匹配过程中, 如何找到点点之间存在对应关系, 便涉及到图像的配准问题. 很显然, 图像配准结果的精确与否直接关系到整个虹膜识别系统的识别精度.

  description: 'Noise removal is an important problem for iris recognition. If the
    iris regions were not correctly segmented in iris images, segmented iris regions
    possibly include noises, namely eyelashes, eyelids, reflections and pupil. Noises
    influence the features of both noise regions and their neighboring regions, which
    will result in poor recognition performance. To solve this problem, this paper
    proposes a method for removing noises and impainting iris images. The whole procedure
    includes three steps: 1) localization and normalization, 2) noise removal based
    on phase congruency and 3) iris image impainting. A series of experiments show
    that the proposed method has encouraging performance for improving the recognition
    accuracy.'

  description: It is very important for the performance evaluation of iris recognition
    algorithms to construct very large iris databases. However, limited by the real
    conditions, there are no very large common iris databases now. In this paper,
    an iris image synthesis method based on principal component analysis (PCA) and
    super-resolution is proposed. The iris recognition algorithm based on PCA is first
    introduced and then, iris image synthesis method is presented. The synthesis method
    first constructs coarse iris images with the given coefficients. Then, synthesized
    iris images are enhanced using super-resolution. Through controlling the coefficients,
    we can create many iris images with specified classes. Extensive experiments show
    that the synthesized iris images have satisfactory cluster and the synthesized
    iris databases can be very large.

  description: 'As the first stage, iris segmentation is very important for an iris
    recognition system. If the iris regions were not correctly segmented, there would
    possibly exist four kinds of noises in segmented iris regions: eyelashes, eyelids,
    reflections and pupil, which result in poor recognition performance. This paper
    proposes a new noise-removing approach based on the fusion of edge and region
    information. The whole procedure includes three steps: 1) rough localization and
    normalization, 2) edge information extraction based on phase congruency, and 3)
    the infusion of edge and region information. Experimental results on a set of
    2,096 images show that the proposed method has encouraging performance for improving
    the recognition accuracy.'

  description: In recent years, iris recognition has received increasing attention

    recognition based on local orientation description. In this approach, a bank of
    Log-Gabor filters are used to capture local orientation characteristics of the
    iris so as to produce discriminating features. Experimental results show that
    the proposed method has an encouraging performance and indicate that differences
    of local details among irises can be well characterized by local orientation information.

  description: Iris recognition is one of the most reliable personal identification
    methods. The potential requirement of obtaining high accuracy is that users supply
    iris images with good quality. It is thus necessary for an iris recognition system
    to operate the possibly blurred iris images due to less cooperation of users and
    camera with low resolution. This paper proposes a new algorithm for resolution
    enhancement of iris images captured by the low resolution camera in less cooperative
    situations. The prior probability relation between the information of different
    frequency bands of iris features useful for recognition is firstly learned. Then,
    it is incorporated into resolution enhancement algorithms to recover the lost
    information for the seriously blurred images. A large number of experiments on
    the CASIA iris database demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.

  authors:

  description: Discrete diffusion models have achieved notable success in tasks like
    image generation and masked language modeling, yet they face limitations in controlled
    content editing. This paper introduces {\bf Discrete Inversion}, the first approach
    to enable precise inversion for discrete diffusion models, including multinomial
    diffusion and masked generative models. By recording noise sequences and masking
    patterns during the forward diffusion process, Discrete Inversion facilitates
    accurate reconstruction and controlled edits without the need for predefined masks
    or attention map manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
    across both image and text domains, evaluating it on models like VQ-Diffusion,
    Paella, and RoBERTa. Our results show that Discrete Inversion not only preserves
    high fidelity in the original data but also enables flexible and user-friendly
    editing in discrete spaces, significantly advancing the capabilities of discrete
    generative models.

  authors:
  - Unknown Author
  description: 'Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) requires retrieving a target image
    based on a composed query consisting of an image and accompanying text that modifies
    or instructs changes to the visual reference. This task is particularly challenging
    as it demands the model effectively follow modification instructions for accurate
    retrieval. Additionally, data acquisition difficulties hinder training models
    for specific tasks. To address these challenges, recent approaches explore Zero-Shot
    CIR (ZS-CIR), mainly leveraging CLIP-based models with tailored projections to
    compose images and textual modifications. However, these base models are not trained
    on instruction-aware data, limiting their ability to effectively combine visual
    and textual cues. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding method utilizing
    an instruction-tuned Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate unified
    embeddings that seamlessly integrate images and modification instructions. Instruction-tuned
    MLLMs inherently align vision and text while exhibiting strong instruction-following
    capabilities, though they are primarily used in text generation. We introduce
    a two-stage training strategy to efficiently transform the MLLM’s text generation
    capabilities into embedding extraction, and further refining its ability to follow
    modification instructions in CIR. Our model demonstrates significant advancements
    in ZS-CIR, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across four public datasets:
    FashionIQ, CIRR, GeneCIS, and CIRCO. Our model highlights the potential of instruction-tuned
    MLLMs in capturing nuanced instruction comprehension and advancing CIR systems.'

  description: 'The network in [1] has one multiple instance detection stream and
    M instance classifier refinement streams, and each stream produces proposal classification
    probabilities. The multiple instance detection stream is supervised by imagelevel
    annotations, and the instance classifier refinement streams are supervised by
    bounding box annotations generated by the network. In particular, for the m-th
    stream, the supervisions are generated by the outputs of the {m− 1}-th stream
    (we denote the multiple instance detection stream as the 0-th stream). Given an
    image I and its image-level annotation y=[y1,..., yK]∈ RK, N region proposals
    P={pn} N n= 1 are generated, where K is the number of object classes, yk= 1/0
    indicates that the image is with/without the k-th object class, and pn is the

    ϕm− 1 kn if the image has the k-th object class (ie yk= 1), and then assigns labels
    to proposals according to the Intersection-over-Union (IoU). The assigning label
    procedure is performed as follows: if the IoU between pn and pnm k is larger than
    a threshold It, pn is assigned the k-th object class label; if the IoU between
    pn and pnm k is not larger than It, pn is assigned the background label. This
    method is motivated by that the top-scoring proposal can cover at least parts

    Deep Hypergraph Learning
  authors:
  - Unknown Author
  description: Deep hypergraph learning receives a surge of interest in recent years.
    Frameworks commonly used in deep hypergraph learning focus on hypergraphs with
    edge-independent vertex weights (EIVWs), without considering hypergraphs with
    edge-dependent vertex weights (EDVWs) which have more modeling power. Moreover,
    many hypergraph convolutional models are straightforward generalizations of graph
    convolutional networks by incorporating simple hypergraph Laplacians, which lack
    expressiveness for encoding the EDVWs information. In this paper, we first propose
    a unified hypergraph random walk and provide the equivalence conditions between
    our unified hypergraph random walks and graph random walks. Guided by the equivalence
    results, we derive a unified random-walk-based hypergraph Laplacian that incorporates
    information of EDVWs. The new Laplacian is more expressive than existing ones
    and admits regular spectral properties. Furthermore, we present General Hypergraph
    Spectral Convolution (GHSC), a general learning framework that not only can handle
    EDVW-hypergraphs but also enables utilizing the existing powerful Graph Convolutional
    Neural Networks (GCNNs) to ease the design of Hypergraph Neural Networks. In this
    framework, the graph Laplacian of the given undirected GCNNs is replaced with
    a unified hypergraph Laplacian by equating our defined generalized hypergraphs
    with weighted undirected graphs. Extensive experiments from various domains demonstrate
    our framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

- title: Weakly Supervised Graph Clustering
  authors:
  - Unknown Author
  description: Graph Clustering, which clusters the nodes of a graph given its collection
    of node features and edge connections in an unsupervised manner, has long been
    researched in graph learning and is essential in certain applications. While this
    task is common, more complex cases arise in practice—can we cluster nodes better
    with some graph-level side information or in a weakly supervised manner as, for
    example, identifying potential fraud users in a social network given additional
    labels of fraud communities. This triggers an interesting problem which we define
    as Weakly Supervised Graph Clustering (WSGC). In this paper, we firstly discuss
    the various possible settings of WSGC, formally. Upon such discussion, we investigate
    a particular task of weakly supervised graph clustering by making use of the graph
    labels and node features, with the assistance of a hierarchical graph that further
    characterizes the connections between different graphs. To address this task,
    we propose Gaussian Mixture Graph Convolutional Network (GMGCN), a simple yet
    effective framework for learning node representations under the supervision of
    graph labels guided by a proposed consensus loss and then inferring the category
    of each node via a Gaussian Mixture Layer (GML). Extensive experiments are conducted
    to test the rationality of the formulation of weakly supervised graph clustering.
    The experimental results show that, with the assistance of graph labels, the weakly
    supervised graph clustering method has a great improvement over the traditional
    graph clustering method.

- title: 'PI-GNN: Towards Robust Semi-Supervised Node Classification against Noisy
    Labels'
  authors:
  - Unknown Author
  description: Semi-supervised node classification on graphs is a fundamental problem
    in graph mining that uses a small set of labeled nodes and many unlabeled nodes
    for training, so that its performance is quite sensitive to the quality of the
    node labels. However, it is expensive to maintain the label quality for real-world
    graph datasets, which presents huge challenges for the learning algorithm to keep
    a good generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel robust learning
    objective dubbed pairwise interactions (PI) for the model, such as Graph Neural
    Network (GNN) to combat against noisy labels. Unlike classic robust training approaches
    that operate on the pointwise interactions between node and class label pairs,
    PI explicitly forces the embeddings for node pairs that hold a positive PI label
    to be close to each other, which can be applied to both labeled and unlabeled
    nodes. We design several instantiations for the PI labels based on the graph structure
    as well as node class labels, and further propose a new uncertainty-aware training
    technique to mitigate the negative effect of the sub-optimal PI labels. Extensive
    experiments on different datasets and GNN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness
    of PI, which also brings a promising improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.

- title: Pareto-Frontier-aware Neural Architecture Search
  authors:
  - Unknown Author
  description: Designing feasible and effective architectures is essential for deploying
    deep models to real-world scenarios. In practice, one has to consider multiple
    objectives (e.g., model performance and computational cost) and diverse constraints
    incurred by different computation resources. To address this, most methods seek
    to find promising architectures via optimizing a well pre-defined utility function.
    However, it is often non-trivial to design an ideal function that could well trade-off
    different objectives. More critically, in many real scenarios, even for the same
    platform, we may have different applications with various latency budgets. To
    find promising architectures under different budgets, existing methods may have
    to perform an independent search for each budget, which is very inefficient and
    unnecessary. Nevertheless, it would be fantastic if we can produce multiple promising
    architectures to fulfill each budget in the same search process. In this paper,
    we propose a Pareto-Frontier-aware Neural Architecture Search (PFNAS) method which
    seeks to learn the Pareto frontier (i.e., the set of Pareto optimal architectures)
    w.r.t. multiple objectives. Here, we formulate the Pareto frontier learning problem
    as a Markov decision process (MDP). Relied on the MDP, we transform and absorb
    the objectives other than model performance into the constraints. To learn the
    whole Pareto frontier, we propose to find a set of Pareto optimal architectures
    which are uniformly distributed on the range of budget to form a frontier. Based
    on the learned frontier, we are able to easily find multiple promising architectures
    to fulfill all considered constraints in the same search process …

- title: Octave Graph Convolutional Network
  authors:
  - Unknown Author
  description: Many variants of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for representation
    learning have been proposed recently and have achieved fruitful results in various
    domains. Among them, spectral-based GCNs are constructed via convolution theorem
    upon theoretical foundation from the perspective of Graph Signal Processing (GSP).
    However, despite most of them implicitly act as low-pass filters that generate
    smooth representations for each node, there is limited development on the full
    usage of underlying information from low-frequency. Here, we first introduce the
    octave convolution on graphs in spectral domain. Accordingly, we present Octave
    Graph Convolutional Network (OctGCN), a novel architecture that learns representations
    for different frequency components regarding to weighted filters and graph wavelets
    bases. We empirically validate the importance of low-frequency components in graph
    signals on semi-supervised node classification and demonstrate that our model
    achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with both spectral-based and
    spatial-based baselines.

- title: Learning Joint Wasserstein Auto-Encoders for Joint Distribution Matching
  authors:
  - Unknown Author
  description: 'We study the joint distribution matching problem which aims at learning
    bidirectional mappings to match the joint distribution of two domains. This problem
    occurs in unsupervised image-to-image translation and video-to-video synthesis
    tasks, which, however, has two critical challenges: (i) it is difficult to exploit
    sufficient information from the joint distribution; (ii) how to theoretically
    and experimentally evaluate the generalization performance remains an open question.
    To address the above challenges, we propose a new optimization problem and design
    a novel Joint Wasserstein Auto-Encoders (JWAE) to minimize the Wasserstein distance
    of the joint distributions in two domains. We theoretically prove that the generalization
    ability of the proposed method can be guaranteed by minimizing the Wasserstein
    distance of joint distributions. To verify the generalization ability, we apply
    our method to unsupervised video-to-video synthesis by performing video frame
    interpolation and producing visually smooth videos in two domains, simultaneously.
    Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our
    method over several state-of-the-arts.'
